Page 9,"Introduction I Beyond Good and Evil (BGE ) is often considered to be one of Friedrich Nietzsche’s greatest books.Though it is by no means clear what criteria this assessment is based on, it is easy to understand how it comes about. Itseems to be an expression of the feeling that in this book Nietzsche givesthe most comprehensible and detached account of the major themes thatconcerned him throughout his life. Nietzsche was suspicious of almosteverything addressed in this book – whether it be knowledge, truth, phi- losophy , or morality and religion. He regarded them as the source, or atleast the effect, of a misguided tendency in the development of humannature: one that has led to disastrous cultural, social, and psychologicalconsequences. At the same time he lets us share his more constructiveviews as well, mainly his views on how he wants us to perceive the worldand to change our lives in order to live up to this new perception. He speaksof perspectivism, the will to power, of human nobility ( Vornehmheit ) and of the conditions of a life liberated from the constraints of oppressivetradition. In the middle of the book, he even adds a number of short I thank Dartmouth College and especially Sally Sedgwick and Margaret Robinson, whose generous hospitality gave me the opportunity to write this text.

Page 10,"Introduction aphorisms, and he ends the book with a poem that hints at the artistic background to his concern with decadence and the means for overcomingit. Thus it would seem that the whole range of Nietzsche’s interests, hisprejudices and his preferences, his loathings and his hopes, and above all his deep insights into our situation in the modern world, are united in anexemplary way in BGE , and for this reason it is a great book. Although there is something to be said for this view , it is not the only view that is possible. There are quite a number of thinkers who would in-sist that it makes no sense at all to attribute greatness to any of Nietzsche’sworks. For these readers, all of Nietzsche’s writings are ﬂawed by serious shortcomings that justify fundamental complaints, ranging from accusa-tions that they are utterly irrational, or devoid of informative content, tothe conviction that they contain nothing but silly proclamations based onunwarranted generalizations – or a mixture of both. According to pro- ponents of this view , the best way to think of Nietzsche’s works is as thedisturbing documents of the creative process of someone who was on theverge of madness. To call any of his works great would therefore amountto a categorical mistake. Interestingly enough, this bleak evaluation is notbased on any disagreement with what the work’s admirers tell us we willﬁnd in it, or even any disagreement with the claim that it gives us thequintessential Nietzsche. It is a perplexing fact that it is by no means easy to decide which of these two conﬂicting attitudes towards BGE should prevail, and in the end it may be a rather personal matter. Nevertheless it is possible to identify someconditions that will inﬂuence how we are likely to think about the meritsof this work. Three main factors should be taken into consideration. First,much depends on how we interpret the aims pursued by Nietzsche’s workin general and BGE in particular. Second, our evaluation will depend on the amount of tolerance and sympathy that we are prepared to mobilizetowards Nietzsche the person, and also towards certain tendencies inbourgeois culture in Germany in the second half of the nineteenth century .The third and most important factor, however, is the way that we feel aboutthe very framework in which all our dealings with what we take to be realityare embedded: if we are conﬁdent that our normal outlook on whateverconcerns us has been proven to be ultimately right, or at least on the righttrack, then chances are high that we will end up thinking of NietzscheandBGE as a nuisance. If we are not convinced of the soundness of our normal views, then we might have second thoughts about things, and in viii",605
Page 11,"Introduction that case a book like BGE might be considered illuminating and even helpful. II Let us start with Nietzsche the person. In the history of art, science,philosophy , and even literature one very often ﬁnds that in order to ap-preciate or to evaluate a work it is not much of an advantage to be familiarwith its author and his life: an intellectual or artistic product is betterjudged on its own merits than on the basis of uncertain knowledge aboutthe idiosyncratic features and muddled purposes of its author. Moreover,in some cases authors intentionally withdraw from their products in anattempt to become invisible and to let the work speak for itself, and thusleave us very few personal clues in their works. Rousseau could serve asan example of the ﬁrst kind of case and Kant of the second; Kant goes sofar as to use the phrase de nobis ipsis silemus (“of our own person we will say nothing”) as a motto for his main work. W e therefore tend to believethat a distinction can be drawn between the private views of the authorand the meaning of the work which the author produces. Y et there are some works with respect to which such a consideration does not so easily apply . These are works whose very meaning is tiedintrinsically to the person of their author, as is the case with diaries,letters, personal notes, or autobiographies. Here our knowledge about theauthor, or perhaps an understanding of the situation the author is in, arenecessary ingredients for an appreciation of the text. There are manyreasons to presume that Nietzsche thought of many of his texts as beinglike diaries or personal notes that tell us something about himself andabout his perspective on the matters they address, rather than as productsthat aim at objective, non-personal results. Hence, his biography may beof interest in any attempt to assess his work. Nietzsche’s life is surely not a success story; on the contrary , it is a rather sad story of misery and failure. It is the story of a man who fromthe beginning of his adult life, until the sudden and catastrophic end ofhis productive period, was confronted with embarrassing and humiliatingexperiences. This is true of his private life as well as of his relations withthe intellectual community of his time. He was plagued by ill health, apsychosomatic wreck, suffering from all sorts of diseases ranging fromchronic nervous ailments and severe eye problems, which left him almost ix",522
Page 12,"Introduction blind, to extremely exhausting states of prolonged migraine. These con- ditions made life tolerable for him only in a few places in northern Italy(in the winter) and the Swiss Engadine (in the summer), and it is in theseplaces that he spent most of his time in the  s. His social relations were always, to put it mildly , somewhat complicated. Those who appar-ently cared most about him, his mother and his sister, he found oppressiveand distasteful because they represented a type of personality he deeplydespised. Though he prided himself on being comfortable with women, he does not seem to have been very successful in establishing emotionallysatisfying relationships with them, which is hardly surprising given hisviews on women and on femininity ( Weiblichkeit ) in general. Things did not go much better with his friends. The people whom he called “friends”he quite often spoke of with great resentment: he charged all of them witha lack of sensitivity toward him, he complained that none of them everbothered to study his works, and he accused them of failing to defend himagainst public neglect. In short, he suffered deeply from a sense of soli- tude and isolation, from not being appropriately acknowledged becauseof the supposed imperfections of the people around him. To make things even worse, Nietzsche was not given the opportunity to compensate for the shortcomings of his private life by enjoying insti-tutional and public success in his roles as a university teacher and author.Although he made a very promising start – he was appointed professor of classics at Basle university at the early age of twenty-four – his academiccareer disintegrated rapidly , in part because of his poor health and in partbecause he became annoyed with his teaching duties. As for his fortunesas an author, not much can be said that is positive. His ﬁrst book, thenow highly acclaimed treatise The Birth of Tragedy , did at least attract the attention of classicists (though their reaction to it was for the most See the annihilating remark aimed at both of them in Ecce Homo which culminates in Nietzsche’s pronouncement: “I confess that the deepest objection to the Eternal Recurrence, my real idea fromthe abyss, is always my mother and my sister” ( KSA VI,§ , translation from Tanner, Nietzsche , p.).KSA refers to S¨amtliche Werke: Kritische Studienausgabe , ed. G. Colli and M. Montinari,  vols. (de Gruyter: Berlin,  ); this edition is based on the critical edition of Nietzsche’s works, Werke: Kritische Gesamtausgabe, ed. G. Colli and M. Montinari, vols. to date (de Gruyter: Berlin,  –). Though Nietzsche addresses this topic in BGE as well ( §et seq .), the general tendency of his outlook on women is documented most succinctly in the relevant passage of Ecce Homo (“Why I write such good books,” §). A good example of this assessment of his friends is again to be found in Ecce Homo (“The case of Wagner,” §). x",779
Page 13,"Introduction part emphatically negative) and of members of the Wagnerian community (including Wagner himself).But soon he had to realize that there was only a marginal interest among the public in his way of dealing with issues,whether they were philosophical topics such as truth and the metaphysi-cal foundations of knowledge, topics concerning the history and value ofreligion and morality , or topics such as the critical assessment of modernculture and ideas about how to overcome what he considered to be thefundamental problems of modernity . This lack of interest showed in thedismal number of copies sold of his books.  The most discouraging experience for Nietzsche, however, may not have been this failure to gain a wider recognition. If he could have believedthat his few readers represented some sort of elite, perhaps a group ofdistinguished intellectuals, then their taking notice of his writings wouldhave been of importance to him and this might have counterbalanced hislack of public success. Unfortunately he could not entertain even thatbelief. From the very few reactions he became aware of – mostly reviewsof his books in more or less obscure journals – he had to conclude that he was read by only a few readers – and the wrong ones. In his view ,his readership consisted of people either unable or unwilling (or both)to understand him adequately . He blamed his readers for not being inthe least prepared to give credit to his intentions and for being attentiveonly to those points which conveniently conﬁrmed them in their ownnegative preconceptions. What he was missing on a fundamental levelwas a readiness on the part of readers to explore things his way , a feelingof intellectual kinship between author and audience, or, to put it anotherway , he deeply craved recognition from an audience that he thought ﬁtting.This is touchingly expressed in two short remarks from Ecce Homo . The ﬁrst relates explicitly only to his Zarathustra, though it is quite likely that Nietzsche thought it true of his other writings as well: “In order to See the Introduction by Raymond Geuss to the edition of The Birth of Tragedy in this series (Cambridge University Press,  ). Of the book Nietzsche valued most, Zarathustra , whose ﬁrst three parts were published separately in and , only about sixty to seventy copies each were sold within the ﬁrst three years after their appearance (see letter to Franz Overbeck, summer  :KSB VII, pp.  –). The fourth part of the Zarathustra was published in  in a private edition of only forty copies and was not accessible to a wider public before  .BGE did not fare much better:  copies were sold within a year (see letter to Peter Gast, June  :KSB VIII, pp. –). Nietzsche comments (in the same letter to Gast): “Instructive! Namely , they simply don’t want my literature.” It seems that most of his other books had the same fate – they too were utterly neglected during the periodin his life when he would still have cared about their success. xi",769
Page 14,"Introduction understand anything at all from my Zarathustra , you might need to be conditioned as I am – with one foot beyond life.”The second remark delineates what he takes to be his ideal reader, and there is no doubt thathe meant what he says: “When I call up the image of a perfect reader,what emerges is a monster of courage and curiosity , who is also supple,clever, cautious, a born adventurer and discoverer.”  What emerges is a picture of a totally isolated, highly neurotic man who had to try hard to avoid thinking of himself as a complete failure. His wayof dealing with this situation seems to have been simply not to accept theidea that all these annoying circumstances might have been brought aboutpartly by particularities or deﬁciencies that could be traced back to hisown person, so he managed to combine a perfectly clear and even realisticassessment of what was happening to him with an unshakeable convictionthat all this had nothing to do with him and revealed nothing about him.It is this ability which, in my view , accounts for two dominant traits thatappear in his published works. The ﬁrst is that he never even came closeto considering the possibility that – given the general intellectual climateof his time – his lack of success as an author might have something to do with his pursuing the “wrong” topics in a “wrong” way . It never crossedhis mind that what he thought to be an interesting, novel, and valuableinsight might indeed have been exactly what it seemed to be to almost allof his contemporaries – an overstated triviality , an extremely one-sidedexaggeration or an embarrassing piece of bad reasoning. He simply stuckto the points he felt he had to make, deeply convinced of being on the righttrack, and fending off all signs of criticism or neglect with the maxim “somuch the worse for the critic.”  Ecce Homo (“Why I am so wise,” end of §). Ibid. (“Why I write such good books,” end of §). In the same text he mentions explicitly the reactions to BGE as an example of how severely it was misunderstood or, to use his terminology , how gravely this book was sinned against because its readers were not up to its challenge (“Why I write such good books,” end of §). InEcce Homo Nietzsche even presents an explanation as to why he believes this stance to be perfectly reasonable: “Ultimately , nobody can get more out of things, including books, than he already knows. For what one lacks access to from experience one will have no ear. Now let us imagine an extreme case: that a book speaks of nothing but events that lie altogether beyond thepossibility of any frequent or even rare experience – that it is the ﬁrst language for a new series of experiences. In that case, simply nothing will be heard, but there will be the acoustic illusion that where nothing is heard, nothing is there ...Whoever thought he had understood something of me, had made up something out of me after his own image ...and whoever had understood nothing of me, denied that I need to be considered at all.” “Why I write such good books,” §, xii",727
Page 15,"Introduction This attitude becomes increasingly visible in his writings after Zarathustra and culminates in his late texts of  , especially in Ecce Homo . Here we ﬁnd brilliant and witty remarks which rightly became notorious (though Nietzsche himself might not have found them veryamusing, because they can also be read as documents of despair). I quotetwo of them: “W e all know , several of us even know from experience,what it is to have long ears. W ell then, I will dare to claim that I havethe smallest ears. This is of no little interest to women – it seems theythink I understand them better? ...I am the anti-ass par excellence and this makes me a world-historical monster – I am, in Greek, but not onlyin Greek, the Antichrist .” The other is: “I know my fate. One day , my name will be associated with the memory of something tremendous – acrisis the like of which the world has never seen, the most profound col-lision of conscience, of a decision brought about against everything that has ever been believed, demanded, or held holy so far. I am not a man. Iam dynamite.”  The second trait which we ﬁnd in Nietzsche’s writings is closely con- nected to his inability to assess himself in the light of others’ reactions.It consists in his total unconcern about the tenability of his views whenjudged according to standards that he thinks are alien to his approach.Starting from the conviction that there is no common ground betweenhim and his reader, that what he has to say is most likely incomprehensi-ble to almost everybody else, he does not feel obliged to enter the socialgame of competitive discourse. He refuses to try to convince people bysomehow connecting to their way of thinking; he does not refute possi-ble arguments against the points he wants to make by giving reasons intheir favor. Instead, he makes abundantly clear his contempt for “nor-mal” thinking and his impatience with the evaluations of others. It is thisstance which gives so many readers the impression of an overwhelmingpolemical element in Nietzsche’s literary presentation of his views. Hereinforces it by insisting over and over again that what he has to tell usare above all histruths. The claim to exclusivity is meant to imply both that his main concern is not whether we ﬁnd these truths convincing, and translation from W . Kaufmann, On the Genealogy of Morals and Ecce Homo (Vintage: New Y ork,  ), p. . Ecce Homo , “Why I write such good books,” end of §, translation Kaufmann, p.  . Ibid ., “Why I am a destiny ,” beginning of §, translation Kaufmann, p.  . xiii",688
Page 16,"Introduction that he does not pretend to have found the Truth, for he thinks this is a metaphysical illusion anyway . Thus we ﬁnd embedded in Nietzsche’s basic view of himself the rec- ommendation not that we read his texts as aiming at “objectively valid”judgments, at judgments that are (metaphysically) true irrespective of thecultural and psychological context in which they are made (whatever thatmay be), but that we think of them as narratives that he invites us to listento, without really obliging us to believe them if we are not the right kindof person. This does not mean that the stories he has to tell us about,say , truth, morality , the will to power, or culture are, in his view , on apar with ﬁctions, pleasant or otherwise. On the contrary , he believed hisstories to be the ultimate stories, the stories that are destined to becomethe standard versions of our assessment of these phenomena. This is notbecause his narratives are objectively , or in a context-free sense, the mostﬁtting; rather, they will succeed because eventually people will change toa condition where they appreciate the fact that these narratives are bestsuited to capture their sense of the right perspective on phenomena ifthey are considered against the background of what for them is the realmeaning of life. Before looking more closely at some aspects of BGE itself, let me sum- marize what I take to be the lessons for approaching Nietzsche’s writingsthat can be learned from his personal situation and his way of dealing withit. They take the form of three warnings: ( ) do not expect these writings to express impartial views on whatever subject they address – they ex-press, in an emphatic sense, Nietzsche’s own views; ( ) do not be annoyed by his obsession with apodictic statements whose immense generalityvery often contradicts both normal expectations of modesty and the mostobvious requirements of common sense – these stylistic eccentricities re-ﬂect his resolute disdain for what most people cherish, especially peoplewho he suspects are not willing to listen to him; ( ) never forget that the author does not want to get mixed up with “us,” his normal insensitive“academic” readers. He does not want to be “one of us” – instead he insists on what he calls “distance,” in order to uphold his view of himselfand to remind us of his uniqueness. A last quotation from Ecce Homo may highlight these points: “ Listen to me [the emphasis is on the ‘me’]. For I am thus and thus. Do not, above all, confound me. ”  Ibid ., Preface, §. xiv",608
Page 17,"Introduction III BGE is the ﬁrst book Nietzsche published after Thus Spoke Zarathustra . He never gave up on the notion that all he really wanted to say is containedinZarathustra , and this led him to claim that the works he wrote after Zarathustra are essentially nothing but elaborations and explications of ideas already present in his opus magnum . This claim has been disputed by quite a number of his commentators, ﬁrstly because many of the most central ideas in Zarathustra cease to play an important role in his later writings, and secondly because the literary form of the later writingsconnects them much more closely to his books prior to Zarathustra than toZarathustra itself. However that may be, Nietzsche himself was of the opinion that Zarathustra set the stage for everything he had to do subsequently . He writes: “The task for the years that followed [i.e. theyears after Zarathustra ] was mapped out as clearly as possible. Once the yes-saying part of my task had been solved [by means of Zarathustra ], it was time for the no-saying, no-doing part.” This seems to imply that he regarded his post- Zarathustra writings as consisting of predominantly critical essays. BGE is best known to a wider public for its proverbs. Indeed, some of Nietzsche’s best-known maxims are assembled in this text, ranging fromperspicuous insights to highly controversial statements. Starting with thePreface, where we ﬁnd his much used and misused saying, “Christianityis Platonism for the ‘people,’” almost every one of the nine parts ofthe book contains lines that have entered the repertoire of educated orpolemical discourse: “life as such is will to power” ( §); “humans are the still undetermined [nicht festgestellte ]animals ”(§); “When a woman has scholarly inclinations, there is usually something wrong with hersexuality” ( § ); “Morality in Europe these days is the morality of herd animals ”(§ ); and (slightly paraphrased here): “saintliness – the highest spiritualization of the instinct of cleanliness” ( § ). These proverbs are in a way the least of what BGE has to offer. Its primary fascination lies on a deeper level: this book introduces us into aworld of remarkable conjectures, suspicions, and implications. Thoughone might say this is true of most of Nietzsche’s other published works aswell, with the exception of Zarathustra , there is nevertheless a difference See, e.g., M. Tanner, Introduction to BGE andNietzsche ,p .. Ecce Homo ,‘Beyond Good and Evil ’,§, translation Kaufmann, p.  . xv",705
Page 18,"Introduction in emphasis between BGE and the other writings. Whereas the other texts pursue their subjects from many different angles, BGE (like The Genealogy of Morals , which Nietzsche announced on the back of its title page as “a sequel to my last book, Beyond Good and Evil , which it is meant to supplement and clarify”) is highly focused on the psychologicalaspects of its topics. In BGE Nietzsche confronts us primarily (though not exclusively) with a dimension of his thought that he was particularlyproud of – his psychological stance. This integration of what he calls apsychological point of view into his general practice of casting doubts onreceived convictions by tracing their origins, of throwing into questionour most fundamental beliefs by pointing out their shakiness, and ofscrutinizing available alternatives in the light of a new vision of the valueof life – this I take to be the most distinctive feature of BGE . Nietzsche himself gives the following account of what he is doing in BGE : “This book (  ) is in every essential a critique of modernity ; mod- ern sciences, modern arts, even modern politics are not excluded. Besidesthis, it is an indication of an opposing type, which is as un-modern as pos-sible, a noble, yes-saying type.” Though this characterization is accurate and conﬁrms the view that Nietzsche considers his task to be mainly acritical one, it is by no means complete. Interestingly enough, it does notmention two topics which some readers take to be the subject of the mostdisturbing reﬂections in the book: morality and religion. This is surpris-ing because these are the topics which seem to emerge most strongly inany consideration of its main message. In order to appreciate the distinctive approach which Nietzsche favors inBGE in his dealings with what he calls “modernity ,” it might be worth- while to say a few words about his more general outlook. The starting pointfor almost everything Nietzsche is interested in throughout his entire in-tellectual career can be nicely summarized in the form of the question“how are we to live?” or, more poignantly , “how are we to endure life?” He considered this question to be of the utmost importance, because ofthree interconnected convictions that he treated virtually as facts. Hisﬁrst conviction was that life is best conceived of as a chaotic dynamicprocess without any stability or direction. The second is articulated inthe claim that we have no reason whatsoever to believe in any such thingas the “sense” or the “value” of life, insofar as these terms imply the idea Ibid . xvi",594
Page 19,"Introduction of an “objective” or “natural” purpose of life. The third is that human life is value-oriented in its very essence – that is, without adherence tosome set of values or other, human life would be virtually impossible.Whereas the ﬁrst conviction is supposed to state an ontological fact, thesecond is meant to be an application of the ontological point to the nor-mative aspects of human life in particular. The third conviction, thoughsomewhat at odds with the other two, is taken by Nietzsche to reveal apsychological necessity . (How Nietzsche came to hold these convictions,and whether they can be supported, there is not space to examine here,although a closer look would no doubt lead back to his use of some ofSchopenhauer’s ideas and to his picture of what constituted the culturallife of pre-Socratic ancient Greece.) Against the background of these convictions, Nietzsche became inter- ested in the question of the origin of values, a question that eventuallyled him to a whole array of unorthodox and original answers. All his an-swers ultimately follow from a pattern of reasoning which in its mostbasic structure is quite simple and straightforward: if there are no values“out there,” in the sense in which we believe stars and other physical objects to be “out there” and if, at the same time, we cannot do withoutvalues, then there must be some value-creating capacity within ourselveswhich is responsible for the values we cherish and which organizes ourlives. Though presumably we are all endowed with this capacity , there are very few of us who manage to create values powerful enough to forcepeople into acceptance and to constitute cultural and social proﬁles. Tocreate such constitutive values seems to be, according to Nietzsche, theprerogative of real philosophers (not philosophy professors), of uniqueartists (if there are any), of even rarer founders of religions, and, aboveall, of institutions that develop out of the teaching of creative individuals,i.e., of science, philosophy , and theology . Thus, anyone interested in thefunction and the origin of values should scrutinize the processes whichenabled these persons and institutions to create values. At this point Nietzsche’s more detailed investigations tend to start spreading out in a remarkable number of different directions. It is here,too, that in one sense we should take BGE to have its point of depar- ture. That the detailed analysis of all the phenomena connected with the For, after all, there seems to be no reason to think that Nietzsche would not allow in principle that each of us could be transformed into a “free spirit,” i.e., a person who has the capacity and strength to create and stick to the “right” values. xvii",608
Page 20,"Introduction concept of value is a very tricky task methodologically is documented not only in BGE but also in almost all of Nietzsche’s other writings. Acknowledging the fact that the different features of the value-creatingprocesses are much too complex to be accessible by means of a singleexplanatory scheme, Nietzsche tentatively pursues several different ap-proaches. He merges psychological hypotheses with causal explanations,and combines them with historical observations and linguistic consid-erations into a multi-perspectival technique that he fondly refers to ashis “genealogical method.” In BGE , where he is occupied mainly with the psychological dimension of the process of value formation, he appliesthis method primarily in an attempt to come to an understanding of thoseaspects of the value problem that pertain to its normative elements, thatis, to the question of good and bad. At the risk of oversimpliﬁcation one can say the bulk of this work addresses three topics, each one of which can be expressed best in termsof a question. The ﬁrst is this: why is it impossible for us to live withoutvalues, why do we need values at all, or, more in line with Nietzsche’sterminology , what is the value of values? The second is this: how does ithappen that the values we and the overwhelming majority of the membersof our culture subscribe to have either been bad from the beginning orhave degenerated into bad values? The third topic is this: what is theright perspective on values; what should we expect values to be? Thoughthese three questions are in a certain sense perennial, Nietzsche relatesthem directly to what he saw as the manifest historical situation of hisage and the prevailing conditions of the cultural tradition he lived in,so much of what he has to say is deeply rooted in his response to latenineteenth-century central European conceptions. This is something weshould never forget when we confront his texts. Nietzsche speaks to usfrom the past, and this fact alone might account for some features of hiswriting that we would now consider idiosyncratic – for example, his wayof talking about women and about national characteristics. IV At this point we face a problem that I take to be crucial for any adequateassessment of Nietzsche’s project. It concerns the manner in which weare to comprehend his approach to the topics under examination. Nowthat we have identiﬁed a number of central questions that he discusses in xviii",527
Page 21,"Introduction BGE, it is tempting to proceed in the way normally used in dealing with philosophical texts: stating the questions addressed, and then trying toline up the arguments that the advocate of a position puts forward in favorof the answers he comes up with. However, in the case of Nietzsche andBGE it is by no means evident that such a procedure would capture what Nietzsche is doing and what BGE is all about. There are few arguments to be found in BGE, and those which can be extracted are seldom of the most convincing kind. Following the normal procedure would alsoencourage the illusion that Nietzsche designed BGE to be understood simply in terms of arguments, whether good or bad, and I cannot ﬁndanything in BGE which would encourage such an illusion.  There is considerable evidence that we should try a different approach, and the clue lies in Nietzsche’s numerous allusions to the practices of whathe calls the “new philosophers.” To be the type of philosopher Nietzschevalues is to follow hunches, to think at a “presto” pace ( § ), to embark on experiments both intellectual and existential ( §§ , ),to transform and to create values ( §§ , ), to put forward hypotheses that are risky: in short, to be interested in what he calls “dangerous perhapses” ( §). One would not expect a person with this conception of philosophy to hold theidea that what counts most in the endeavor to reach highly unorthodoxand sometimes even shocking insights is to be in possession of a “goodargument,” and that one could or should present one’s views in compliancewith this idea. Rather, one would expect such a person to pursue a verydifferent path in expressing his views, which would involve starting with abold claim or striking observation and then using it in a variety of differentways. It might form the basis for an analysis of something in terms of thatclaim or observation, or it might point to a symptom, presupposition, orconsequence of a very general or a very particular state of affairs. It evenmight be related tentatively to topics which at ﬁrst sight have nothing There are passages that make it very hard to believe in this illusion. See, e.g., remarks in § that the activity of reason-giving is a post hoc affair intended to justify “some fervent wish that they have sifted through and made properly abstract,” or (in the same section) his making fun ofSpinoza’s mos geometricus as a masquerade. In my eyes, the most striking passage for discouraging this illusion is to be found in § , where Nietzsche talks about what he calls philosophical states or moods. Here he compares the “right” way of doing philosophy with the “normal” attitude and writes concerning the latter: “Y ou [‘normal’ philosophers] imagine every necessity is a need, a painful having to follow and being compelled.” This “having to follow” and “being compelled” I read as a reference to the procedure of establishing results via sound arguments. Nietzsche uses the German word Versuch (attempt, experiment) in a broad way which makes that term cover the connotations of Versuchung (temptation) and Versucher (tempter) as well. Cf. §. xix",793
Page 22,"Introduction to do with what the original claim or the ﬁrst observation was about. In short, one could envision a philosopher under the spell of Nietzschean“new philosophy” as someone whose methodology is deeply entangled inand in thrall to what could be called “what if ” scenarios.  If this is how a “new philosopher” approaches problems, it seems beside the point to treat Nietzsche’s proclaimed insights as based on arguments.The concept of a “result” or a “solution” also becomes obsolete, since this type of philosophy is obviously not oriented towards results and solutionsunderstood in the sense of statements which can be defended againstthorough critical resistance. Its aim consists instead in the uncoveringof surprising possibilities and the playful presentation of innovative per-spectives that do not aspire to the status of rock-hard “truths” but aremeant to be offerings or propositions for a like-minded spirit.  Nietzsche obviously intended BGE to exemplify as clearly as possible all the characteristics he attributes to the style, the method, and the intentionsof the “new philosophers” – and yet it is remarkable how often this factis not sufﬁciently acknowledged by his interpreters. This oversight isremarkable not only because it seems to be in part responsible for awkwardattempts to integrate Nietzsche’s intellectual products into traditionalacademic philosophy , but above all because it tends to miss what might be called, for want of a better term, the “socio-hermeneutical” dimension ofwhat has become known as his doctrine of “perspectivism.” This doctrine It should go without saying that this imagined scenario does not exclude “good arguments.” Rather, the scenario is meant to show that if one deals with topics in the way outlined above, the guiding intention is not to give or toﬁnd “good arguments.” In Nietzsche’s terminology , this amounts to the claim that a “good argument” is not an overriding methodological “value.” Invoking his polemical inventory , one could say , in his spirit: to be obsessed by “the will to a good argument” indicates bad taste. Again, this characterization is not meant to suggest that what these “new philosophers” areproclaiming is something they are not serious about or do not want us to take seriously . It is onlymeant to emphasize that what they put forward is connected very intimately with their personal point of view , and hence it is nothing that they can force on someone if there is no shared basis of experience, of resentment ( ressentiment ), or suffering. See BGE §, where Nietzsche expresses this point in an especially belligerent fashion. These attempts do not necessarily result in uninformative or misleading accounts of aspects ofNietzsche’s thought. On the contrary , many of them shed considerable light on the historical background of his ideas and on the impact they could have on various discussions that happento take place within the framework of academic philosophy . They are, however, operating under the unavoidable (and, perhaps, reasonable) restrictions of that framework. This puts them in the position of having to abstract from the personal or “perspectival” features essential to Nietzsche’sconceptions. That there is a price to be paid for this “academization” is obvious. It is revealed in the difference between the excitement and fun that one can have in reading Nietzsche and theboredom that one sometimes experiences when reading the literature on him. xx",795
Page 23,"Introduction in its most trivial reading amounts to the claim that our view of the world and, consequently , the statements we take to be true, depend onour situation, on our “perspective” on the world. Perspectivism thusunderstood gives rise to the epistemological thesis that our knowledgeclaims can never be true in an absolute or an objective sense, partly becauseof the necessary spatial and temporal differences between the viewpointsthat each knower is bound to occupy when relating to an object, andalso because of the fact that we can never be certain that what appearsto us to be the case really is the case. Though it is true that in someof his more conventional moods Nietzsche seems to have thought aboutperspectivism along these lines, this reading gives no hint whatsoever ofwhy he should have been attracted to such a doctrine in his more inspiredmoments. In this epistemological version the doctrine is neither originalnor interesting, but merely a version of skeptical or idealist claims thatused to be connected in popular writings with names like Berkeley andKant.  However, perspectivism takes on a much more promising dimension if it is put into the broader context of the problem of justifying or atleast of making plausible an insistence on integrating a personal or sub-jective element into the expression of one’s views as a condition of theirmaking sense at all. By looking at this doctrine in this context, we canappreciate it as stating conditions for understanding an expression thatpurports to express something true, be it a text, a statement, or a con-fession. These conditions can be summarized in terms of two essentialconvictions. ( ) In order to understand a claim for truth embodied in an expression, one has to have an understanding of the situation fromwhich that claim originates, and this presupposes being acquainted withand involved in the personal attitudes, subjective experiences, and pri-vate evaluations which form the basis of the view expressed. ( )I no r d e r Here I have to confess that this sketch of the epistemological interpretation of Nietzsche’s per- spectivism may not be the most sympathetic one, and no doubt one can ﬁnd in the literature muchmore sophisticated versions of this doctrine. However, this does not affect the main point I want to make, which consists in the claim that the epistemological reading misses the central feature of Nietzsche’s doctrine. There are some other misgivings concerning the reading that deservemention. The ﬁrst consists in the fact that Nietzsche – especially in BGE – is not in sympathy with skepticism (see § ). Hence, why should he be interested in putting forward a doctrine containing skeptical implications? A further reservation about the feasibility of the epistemologi- cal reading can be seen in the annoying consequence of having to credit Nietzsche with all sorts of paradoxical and self-refuting claims such as “If perspectivism is true we cannot know it to betrue.” It should be noted that the “German form of skepticism” discussed approvingly in § has nothing to do with epistemological skepticism. xxi",687
Page 24,"Introduction to judge the correctness, or perhaps merely the plausibility , of such a claim, one has to have an experiential or existential background similarto that of the person who made the claim. It is because of this insis-tence on integrating subjective aspects into the process of understanding,and because of the idea that judging the truth of a view presupposesshared experiences, that I call this the “socio-hermeneutical” reading ofperspectivism. If perspectivism is understood in these terms, then much of what is going on in BGE and other texts by Nietzsche begins to look considerably less arbitrary and idiosyncratic than has been claimed. For example, hisso-called “theory of truth” which he alludes to quite often in the ﬁrst twobooks of BGE , seems less absurd than many commentators have taken it to be. According to these critics Nietzsche’s perspectival conceptionof truth endorses the following three statements: ( ) there is no absolute or objective truth; ( ) what is taken to be truth is nothing but a ﬁction, that is, a perspectival counterfeit or forgery ( F¨alschung ) of what really is the case; and ( ) claims ( ) and ( ) are true. These three statements together seem to imply the paradoxical claim that it is true that thereis no truth. So the critic argues. However, when read in the light of the preceding remarks a much less extravagant interpretation of Niet-zsche’s theory of truth suggests itself which is completely independentof the issue of whether he really subscribes to these three statements. Onthis interpretation, Nietzsche’s theory claims only ( ) that there are no context-free truths, where a context is to be deﬁned as the set of subjectiveconditions that the utterer of a truth is governed by and that anyone whowishes correctly to judge it is able to apprehend. It also claims ( ) that as an utterer or judger of a truth we are never in a position to be familiarwith a context in its entirety , that is, with all the conditions that deﬁneit, and therefore we have to settle for an incomplete version of a con-text where the degree of incompleteness depends on differences betweenour capacities to understand ourselves and others. From this it follows() that, given our situation, every truth is deﬁned by this necessarily That there are many epistemological and logical problems connected with holding such a para- doxical claim is not difﬁcult to point out. The most comprehensive discussion of these problems with reference to Nietzsche that I know of is by M. Clark, Nietzsche on Truth and Philosophy (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge,  ). Put a bit more bluntly , this claim amounts to the assertion that the concept “objective or absolute truth” is an empty concept when understood in contraposition to “perspectival truth.” xxii",692
Page 25,"Introduction incomplete context. Thus every truth is a partial truth or a perspectival ﬁction. This “socio-hermeneutical” reading of perspectivism points to a more commonsensical understanding of Nietzsche’s claims regarding truth. Italso suggests that some of the stylistic peculiarities of BGE and other texts had a methodological function. BGE , like most of Nietzsche’s other texts, has an aphoristic form. It looks like a collection of impromptu remarks, each of which explores to a different degree of depth some aspect or otherof a particular observation, speciﬁc claim, or surprising phenomenon.These remarks are numbered and loosely organized into topic-relatedgroups, each one of which carries a short descriptive phrase that functionsas its title. The impression is of an apparently arbitrary compilation ofnotes which are actually presented in an artful, though idiosyncratic way .Thus it has been maintained that we should approach BGE as we would a work of literature rather than strictly in terms of philosophical text.Though this impression is by no means misleading, it fails to be sensitive tothe intentions guiding the architectonic of this text. If a claim is fully com-prehensible only when placed in its appropriate subjective and existentialcontext, then it is incumbent on an author to convey as much informationabout this context as possible. One way of doing this consists in presentinga whole array of thoughts which are designed primarily to inform us aboutthe various subjective stances characteristic of the individual making theclaim. The resulting collection may seem random because it can includealmost any conceivable digression under the pretense of being informativeabout the subjective context. However, if the socio-hermeneutical inter-pretation is correct, the seeming randomness of Nietzsche’s aphorismscan equally well be taken as a calculated and methodologically appropri-ate consequence of his perspectivism. In Nietzsche’s writings, as in life,randomness can turn out to be an applied method in disguise. It should be noticed that this reading is compatible with some of the most disturbing features of Nietzsche’s talk about truth. It allows us to make sense of his insistence that there are degrees of truth, which is exhibited most clearly in BGE in his reﬂection on how much “truth” one can take (§). It also makes understandable the idea, very important to him, that truth is just a special case of error. And it allows for the use of personal pronouns in connection with truth, a habit Nietzsche is very fond of (cf. §§,, ). Though there is some question as to the applicability of terms such as “aphorism” or “aphoristic form” to Nietzsche’s texts, he himself does not seem to have problems with such a characterization.His own use of these terms in reference to his writings is documented in On the Genealogy of Morals , Preface §(KSA V, p.  )a n d §(KSA V, p.  )a n di n Twilight of Idols ,§§, (KSA VI, p.  ). xxiii",745
Page 26,"Introduction V BGE deals with questions of how values arise psychologically and how we should evaluate them. It discusses the origin and the meaning of philo-sophical values such as truth, the religious practice of establishing andenforcing speciﬁc values such as faith, piety , and love of man, and themotives and mechanisms involved in our cultivation of moral values suchas pity , fairness, and willingness to help each other. It also treats suchpolitical and social values as democracy , equality , and progress, seeingthem as means of oppression and as indicators of decay and degeneration.Most of this is done with the aim of ﬁnding out what brought about themodern way of life, and what made modern culture such a doomed en-terprise. The general tendency of the book is to claim that at the base ofthe most deeply habitualized normative evaluations that modern peopletake for granted, their most fundamental judgments about what has tobe considered “good” or “bad” in almost every sphere of human activity , there ultimately lies a mixture of appalling character traits, ranging fromweakness and fear to wishful thinking and self-betrayal, and all these ﬁndtheir symptomatic expression in the modern condition. Neither this critical message nor the material Nietzsche relies upon in order to substantiate his assessment of modernity is peculiar to BGE .I n almost all his other writings, he discusses the shortcomings of philoso- phy , the dangers of religion, the built-in biases of science, and the dam-aging consequences of institutionalized moral and cultural values, and hearrives at similar bleak conclusions. Thus, the message of BGE is just an- other version of Nietzsche’s general project. However, BGE is distinctive not only in its emphasis on a psychological explanation of the rise to domi-nance of speciﬁc values, but also in two further respects. The ﬁrst relates tothe doctrine of the “will to power,” the second to his views on what might be called “good” or “adequate” ways of confronting reality . Both topics be-long to his relatively rare excursions into the world of “positive” thinking. Obviously this overlap is intended by Nietzsche. It seems to be an architectonic device, for he frequently quotes from and alludes to his other texts. The best example of this practice is to be foundright at the beginning ( §)o fBGE where he cites almost verbatim from the beginning of Human, All Too Human . This quotation refers to his diagnosis of the most fundamental mistake of traditional metaphysicians, i.e., their conception of the origin of oppositions. Cf. B. Glatzeder: ‘Perspektiven der W¨ unschbarkeit’. Nietzsches Metaphysikkritik in Menschliches Allzumenschliches (Philo V erlag: Berlin,  ). In quoting this appraisal, which forms the basis of his far reaching criticism of metaphysics and its notion of “objective” truth, he can treat it like a result whose justiﬁcation isalready given elsewhere. xxiv",705
Page 27,"Introduction The “will to power” makes its ﬁrst public appearance in Thus Spoke Zarathustra . There it is introduced as one of the three major teachings Zarathustra has to offer, the other two being his advocacy of the over-man ( ¨Ubermensch ) and the conception of the Eternal Recurrence. It is somewhat surprising that in Zarathustra Nietzsche has little to say about what the “will to power” means. Fortunately he is a bit more explicit inBGE , although here too the doctrine receives what is by no means an exhaustive treatment. There is, however, some evidence that he wants us to think of this doctrine as advancing or at least implying an ontologicalhypothesis. Focusing on the hints he gives in BGE , the following picture emerges: if we look at the phenomenon of organic life as an integral partof reality , we ﬁnd that it consists not in a static condition but in a dynamicand chaotic process of creation and decay , of overpowering and becomingoverpowered, of suppressing and being suppressed. This suggests thatwhat governs these processes is some sort of power struggle where everysingle form of life has a tendency to overpower every other form. However,to think of life in this way we have to assume that each living particle isendowed with a certain amount of power that it has a will to realize. Thisamount is supposed to deﬁne its “will to power” and thus is ultimately decisive for its ability to develop itself and to survive, or, to use a famousNietzschean phrase, for its potential to become what it is. It is this line ofthought which led Nietzsche to the assertion that life is “will to power”( §§, ). But this is merely one part of the story . In BGE Nietzsche tentatively tries to pursue the conception of a “will to power” in a further direction.He aims at a broader application of the conception by transforming itfrom a principle of organic life into a much broader axiom pertaining tothe essence of nature in general. It is here that it acquires an ontologicalmeaning. The main motive for his attempt to conceive of the “will topower” as a general ontological principle seems to be that there is no It is because of the relatively superﬁcial and vague treatment of this doctrine in his published writings that many interpretations of the meaning and function of “will to power” rely heavily on Nietzsche’s Nachlass , the voluminous collection of his unpublished notes. However, though the Nachlass indeed contains a considerable amount of material pertaining to that conception, it has the disadvantage of giving support to widely divergent, if not contradictory , interpretations. This is due to the fact that Nietzsche seems to have been experimenting with different meanings of this concept without reaching a deﬁnite position. To appreciate the whole range of readings possible see, for example, G. Abel, Nietzsche: Die Dynamik der Willen zur Macht und die ewige Wiederkehr (de Gruyter: Berlin,  ,nd edn), and V . Gerhardt, Vom Willen zur Macht: Anthropologie und Metaphysik der Macht am exemplarischen Fall Friedrich Nietzsches (de Gruyter: Berlin,  ). xxv",761
Page 28,"Introduction reason to restrict the explanatory force of that concept to organic life. Why not think of inorganic matter, of the material world, in terms of“will to power” as well? Matter would then have to be conceived as “will to power” paralyzed, as “will to power” in a state of potentiality . According to Nietzsche this view would allow for a uniﬁed account of the world in itstotality: “The world seen from inside, the world determined and describedwith respect to its ‘intelligible character’ – would be just this will to power and nothing else” ( §). This view would also have the advantage of overcoming the basic bias of traditional metaphysics that there is adifference in kind between being and becoming, because it implies thatbeing static and stable is in the end nothing but a degenerative form ofbecoming, or nothing but an unactualized power process. It goes withoutsaying that Nietzsche is very much in favor of this claim. Even if it is conceded that Nietzsche never really elaborated his concept of the “will to power” sufﬁciently , it does not appear to be one of his moreattractive ideas. The reason for this is that it purports to give us insight intothe essence of nature, what nature is “in itself,” but this does not square well with his emphatic criticism, put forward in BGE and elsewhere, of the very notion of an “in itself.” According to Nietzsche there is no“in itself,” no essence, no ﬁxed nature of things, and all beliefs to thecontrary are founded on deep and far-reaching metaphysical illusions.It seems therefore that one cannot avoid the unsettling conclusion thatthe doctrine of a “will to power” shares all the vices which Nietzsche attributes to metaphysical thinking in general. There are no such untoward consequences of the second piece of “posi- tive” thinking in BGE , but this is because it scarcely qualiﬁes as thinking at all, consisting instead of fantasies about what the ideal conditions would befor a person to be able to participate in productive thinking. Here produc-tive thinking seems to mean the capacity to live up to the task of enduringan unbiased assessment of reality . Nietzsche summarizes these fantasiesin the picture he gives of the “new philosophers” and in remarks on what it means to be noble. Nobility , for him, has to do with putting oneself at adistance from people and things. It is rooted in and is the product of the“pathos of distance,” to use his inﬂuential formula ( § ). This pathos has to be conceived as the socially inherited ability ( ) to have a sense for differences in rank between persons, ( ) to accept these differences as pointing to differences in distinction (deﬁned as a positive quality ofworthiness), and ( ) to strive for higher distinction. A person possessing xxvi",663
Page 29,"Introduction this ability is able to strive for unique states of awareness: “Without the pathos of distance ...that other more mysterious pathos could not have grown at all, that demand for new expansions of distance within the soulitself, the development of states that are increasingly high, rare, distant,tautly drawn and comprehensive, and, in short, the enhancement of thetype ‘man,’ the constant ‘self-overcoming of man’ (to use a moral formulain a supra-moral sense)” ( § ). The ability to achieve such states seems to function as a condition of gaining important insights and havingthe psychological resources needed to live with them, and it indicates a cer-tain stance towards reality superior to “normal” or “common” attitudes(cf. § ). With this plea for nobility Nietzsche states again his conviction that what ultimately counts in our epistemic dealings with reality is not knowl-edge per se , that is, knowledge detached from the knower. What deserves the title of knowledge has to be intimately connected with the specialand unique situation a knowing subject is in. This is so not only becauseaccording to Nietzsche knowledge is not an “objective” or impersonalaffair, something one can have like a detached thing that one possesses,but above all because the knowing subject has to live his knowledge. The extent to which a subject can do this depends on personal constitution,character traits, and intellectual robustness. Knowledge thus becomes as-sociated with the question of how much truth one can endure (cf. §). It is in this context that the concept of nobility reveals itself to be part ofa “positive” teaching: nobility that is the product of the social pathos of distance increases the potential of a subject for enduring “uncommon”knowledge because it promotes more comprehensive states, and these inturn indicate a growing strength in the subject’s character that enables itto cope with more of “the truth.” This at least seems to be Nietzsche’smessage. What is it that makes reading BGE and other writings of Nietzsche such an attractive and stimulating experience? The main reason, I believe, haslittle to do with the plausibility , let alone the correctness, of his views. Onthe contrary , we like many of his ideas precisely because of their pointedone-sidedness, their extravagance, and their eccentricity . Nor, I suspect,are we now especially preoccupied with the topics which he obviouslytook to be decisive for an evaluation of our way of living under modernconditions. Many of his themes we now consider rather obsolete, andto some of them we no longer have any immediate access because they xxvii",592
Page 30,"Introduction are deeply rooted in their nineteenth-century contexts. The fascination his works still have must therefore originate from somewhere else. If onewants to account for the appeal of his writings, it is perhaps advisablenot to look too closely at his actual teachings, but to think of his texts asa kind of mental tonic designed to encourage his readers to continue toconfront their doubts and suspicions about the well-foundedness of manyof their most fundamental ideas about themselves and their world. Thiswould suggest that Nietzsche’s works may still be captivating because theyconfront a concern that is not restricted to modern times. They addressour uncomfortable feeling that our awareness of ourselves and of theworld depends on conceptions that we ultimately do not understand. W econceive of ourselves as subjects trying to live a decent life, guided in ourdoings by aims that ﬁt the normal expectations of our social and culturalenvironment; we believe certain things to be true beyond any doubt, andwe hold others and ourselves to many moral obligations. Although all thisis constitutive of a normal way of life, we have only a vague idea of whywe have to deal with things in this way; we do not really know what inthe end justiﬁes these practices. In questioning not the normality but theobjectivity or truth of such a normal world view , Nietzsche’s writings canhave the effect of making us feel less worried about our inability to accountfor some of our central convictions in an “absolute” way . It is up to eachof us to decide whether to be grateful for this reminder or to loathe it. Rolf-Peter Horstmann xxviii",349

Nietzsche’s own assessment of the aims and merits of BGE can be found in his late auto- biographical work Ecce Homo , written in  and published in  . The literature on Nietzsche is immense, though there are almost no books and very few articles dealing directly and exclusively with BGE . Titles worth mentioning would be: A.

Some people might ﬁnd it rewarding to approach Nietzsche’s thought before reading about its biographical background. There are quite anumber of interesting and well-researched (German) biographies, ofwhich the best known are C. P . Janz, Friedrich Nietzsche. Biographie , vols. (Hanser V erlag: Munich,  –), W . Ross, Der ¨angstliche Adler xxxii",694
Page 35,"Further reading (Deutsche V erlags-Anstalt: Stuttgart,  ), and R. Safranski, Nietzsche. Biographie seines Denkens (Hanser V erlag: Munich,  ). All of these works discuss aspects of BGE as well. Nietzsche, his themes, and his topics have been subject to some very dif- ferent interpretations, depending on the philosophical tradition in whichthe interpreter is located. This has led to quite interesting “regional”schools of interpretation, especially with respect to the will-to-powerdoctrine and to Nietzsche’s epistemological views, topics which surfaceprominently in BGE . These schools are best characterized in geographical terms as “German,” “French,” and “ Anglo-American.” The best-known and most inﬂuential representative of the “German,” metaphysically ori-ented school is Martin Heidegger, whose two-volume study Nietzsche (Neske: Pfullingen,  ; English translation: Harper and Row: New Y ork,  ) had an enormous impact on the discussion about Nietzsche and his role in the history of metaphysics, at least in parts of Europe.The “French” school, which tends to be more interested in the destruc- tive or “deconstructive” motives in Nietzsche’s thought, is impressivelyrepresented in the works of Gilles Deleuze, Nietzsche et la philosophie (Presses Universitaires de France: Paris,  ), and Nietzsche (Presses Universitaires de France: Paris,  ), P . Klossovski, Nietzsche et le cercle vicieux (Mercure de France: Paris,  ), and S. Kofman, Nietzsche et la metaphore (Editions Payot: Paris,  ). Their books have led to lively con- troversies not only about speciﬁc Nietzschean views but also about how toread Nietzsche at all. The “ Anglo-American” school seems to be mainlyinterested in integrating Nietzsche into the gallery of “serious” thinkers,committed to what their emissaries take to be the normal standards ofrationality . Convincing examples of this approach are A. Nehemas,Nietzsche: Life as Literature (Harvard University Press: Cambridge,  ), and M. Clark, Nietzsche on Truth and Philosophy (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge,  ). All of these schools and all the books mentioned have interesting things to say on many aspects of Nietzsche’s views thatare expressed in BGE . xxxiii",677

Page 39,"Preface Suppose that truth is a woman – and why not? Aren’t there reasons for suspecting that all philosophers, to the extent that they have been dogma-tists, have not really understood women? That the grotesque seriousnessof their approach towards the truth and the clumsy advances they havemade so far are unsuitable ways of pressing their suit with a woman? Whatis certain is that she has spurned them – leaving dogmatism of all typesstanding sad and discouraged. Ifit is even left standing! Because there are those who make fun of dogmatism, claiming that it has fallen over, thatit is lying ﬂat on its face, or more, that dogmatism is in its last gasps. Butseriously , there are good reasons for hoping that all dogmatizing in philos-ophy was just noble (though childish) ambling and preambling, howeversolemn, settled and decisive it might have seemed. And perhaps the timeis very near when we will realize again and again just what actually served as the cornerstone of those sublime and unconditional philosophicalediﬁces that the dogmatists used to build – some piece of folk super-stition from time immemorial (like the soul-superstition that still causestrouble as the superstition of the subject or I), some word-play perhaps, aseduction of grammar or an over-eager generalization from facts that arereally very local, very personal, very human-all-too-human. Let us hopethat the dogmatists’ philosophy was only a promise over the millennia, aswas the case even earlier with astrology , in whose service perhaps more la-bor, money , ingenuity , and patience was expended than for any real scienceso far. W e owe the great style of architecture in Asia and Egypt to astrol-ogy and its “supernatural” claims.

W e should not be ungrateful towards dogmatism,but it must nonetheless be said that the worst, most prolonged, and mostdangerous of all errors to this day was a dogmatist’s error, namely Plato’sinvention of pure spirit and the Good in itself. But now that it has beenovercome, and Europe breathes a sigh of relief after this nightmare, andat least can enjoy a healthier – well – sleep, we, whose task is wakefulness itself , are the heirs to all the force cultivated through the struggle against this error. Of course: talking about spirit and the Good like Plato didmeant standing truth on its head and disowning even perspectivism , which is the fundamental condition of all life. In fact, as physicians we could ask:“How could such a disease infect Plato, the most beautiful outgrowth of antiquity? Did the evil Socrates corrupt him after all? was Socrates in fact the corrupter of youth? did he deserve his hemlock?” – But the struggleagainst Plato, or, to use a clear and “popular” idiom, the struggle againstthe Christian-ecclesiastical pressure of millennia – since Christianity isPlatonism for the “people” – has created a magniﬁcent tension of spiritin Europe, the likes of which the earth has never known: with such atension in our bow we can now shoot at the furthest goals. Granted, theEuropean experiences this tension as a crisis or state of need; and twicealready there have been attempts, in a grand fashion, to unbend the bow ,once through Jesuitism, and the second time through the democraticEnlightenment: – which, with the help of freedom of the press and circu-lation of newspapers, might really insure that spirit does not experienceitself so readily as “need”! (Germans invented gunpowder – all honorsdue! But they made up for it – they invented the press.) But we, whoare neither Jesuits nor democrats, nor even German enough, we good Europeans and free, very free spirits – we still have it, the whole need of spirit and the whole tension of its bow!

What strange,terrible, questionable questions! That is already a long story – and yetit seems to have hardly begun? Is it any wonder if we ﬁnally becomesuspicious, lose patience, turn impatiently away? That we ourselves are also learning from this Sphinx to pose questions? Who is it really that questions us here? What in us really wills the truth? In fact, we paused for a long time before the question of the cause of this will – until weﬁnally came to a complete standstill in front of an even more fundamentalquestion. W e asked about the value of this will. Granted, we will truth: why not untruth instead? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the value of truth came before us, – or was it we who came before theproblem? Which of us is Oedipus? Which one is the Sphinx? It seemswe have a rendezvous of questions and question-marks. – And, believe itor not, it ultimately looks to us as if the problem has never been raiseduntil now , – as if we were the ﬁrst to ever see it, ﬁx our gaze on it, risk it . Because this involves risk and perhaps no risk has ever been greater.  “How could anything originate out of its opposite? Truth from error, for instance? Or the will to truth from the will to deception? Or selﬂess ac-tion from self-interest? Or the pure, sun-bright gaze of wisdom from acovetous leer? Such origins are impossible, and people who dream about ",403
Page 42,"Beyond Good and Evil such things are fools – at best. Things of the highest value must have another, separate origin of their own , – they cannot be derived from this ephemeral, seductive, deceptive, lowly world, from this mad chaos of con-fusion and desire. Look instead to the lap of being, the everlasting, thehidden God, the ‘thing-in-itself ’ – this is where their ground must be, and nowhere else!” – This way of judging typiﬁes the prejudices by which metaphysicians of all ages can be recognized: this type of valuation lies be-hind all their logical procedures. From these “beliefs” they try to acquiretheir “knowledge,” to acquire something that will end up being solemnly christened as “the truth.” The fundamental belief of metaphysicians is thebelief in oppositions of values . It has not occurred to even the most cautious of them to start doubting right here at the threshold, where it isactually needed the most – even though they had vowed to themselves “ de omnibus dubitandum .” But we can doubt, ﬁrst, whether opposites even exist and, second, whether the popular valuations and value oppositionsthat have earned the metaphysicians’ seal of approval might not only beforeground appraisals. Perhaps they are merely provisional perspectives,perhaps they are not even viewed head-on; perhaps they are even viewedfrom below , like a frog-perspective, to borrow an expression that painterswill recognize. Whatever value might be attributed to truth, truthfulness,and selﬂessness, it could be possible that appearance, the will to deception,and craven self-interest should be accorded a higher and more fundamen-tal value for all life. It could even be possible that whatever gives valueto those good and honorable things has an incriminating link, bond, ortie to the very things that look like their evil opposites; perhaps they areeven essentially the same. Perhaps! – But who is willing to take chargeof such a dangerous Perhaps! For this we must await the arrival of a newbreed of philosophers, ones whose taste and inclination are somehow thereverse of those we have seen so far – philosophers of the dangerous Per-haps in every sense. – And in all seriousness: I see these new philosophersapproaching.  I have kept a close eye on the philosophers and read between their linesfor long enough to say to myself: the greatest part of conscious thought Cf.Human, All too Human ,I , §. Everything is to be doubted. ",581
Page 43,"On the prejudices of philosophers must still be attributed to instinctive activity , and this is even the case for philosophical thought. This issue needs re-examination in the same waythat heredity and “innate characteristics” have been re-examined. Justas the act of birth makes no difference to the overall course of heredity ,neither is “consciousness” opposed to instinct in any decisive sense – most of a philosopher’s conscious thought is secretly directed and forced intodeterminate channels by the instincts. Even behind all logic and its au-tocratic posturings stand valuations or, stated more clearly , physiologicalrequirements for the preservation of a particular type of life. For example,that the determinate is worth more than the indeterminate, appearanceworth less than the “truth”: despite all their regulative importance forus, these sorts of appraisals could still be just foreground appraisals, a particular type of niaiserie , precisely what is needed for the preservation of beings like us. But this assumes that it is not man who is the “measureof things” ...  W e do not consider the falsity of a judgment as itself an objection to a judg- ment; this is perhaps where our new language will sound most foreign. Thequestion is how far the judgment promotes and preserves life, how well itpreserves, and perhaps even cultivates, the type. And we are fundamen-tally inclined to claim that the falsest judgments (which include syntheticjudgments a priori ) are the most indispensable to us, and that without ac- cepting the ﬁctions of logic, without measuring reality against the whollyinvented world of the unconditioned and self-identical, without a constantfalsiﬁcation of the world through numbers, people could not live – that a renunciation of false judgments would be a renunciation of life, a negationof life. To acknowledge untruth as a condition of life: this clearly meansresisting the usual value feelings in a dangerous manner; and a philoso-phy that risks such a thing would by that gesture alone place itself beyondgood and evil.  What goads us into regarding all philosophers with an equal measure ofmistrust and mockery is not that we are struck repeatedly by how innocent Silliness. ",512
Page 44,"Beyond Good and Evil they are – how often and easily they err and stray , in short, their childish childlikeness – but rather that there is not enough genuine honesty aboutthem: even though they all make a huge, virtuous racket as soon as theproblem of truthfulness is even remotely touched upon. They all act as ifthey had discovered and arrived at their genuine convictions through theself-development of a cold, pure, divinely insouciant dialectic (in contrastto the mystics of every rank, who are more honest than the philosophersand also sillier – they talk about “inspiration” –): while what essentially happens is that they take a conjecture, a whim, an “inspiration” or, moretypically , they take some fervent wish that they have sifted through andmade properly abstract – and they defend it with rationalizations afterthe fact. They are all advocates who do not want to be seen as such; for the most part, in fact, they are sly spokesmen for prejudices that they christen as “truths” – and very far indeed from the courage of conscience that confesses to this fact, this very fact; and very far from having the goodtaste of courage that also lets this be known, perhaps to warn a friend orfoe, or out of a high-spirited attempt at self-satire. The stiff yet demuretartuffery used by the old Kant to lure us along the clandestine, dialecticalpath that leads the way (or rather: astray) to his “categorical imperative” –this spectacle provides no small amusement for discriminating spectatorslike us, who keep a close eye on the cunning tricks of the old moralists andpreachers of morals. Or even that hocus pocus of a mathematical formused by Spinoza to arm and outﬁt his philosophy (a term which, when allis said and done, really means “ hislove of wisdom”) and thus, from the very start, to strike terror into the heart of the attacker who would dare tocast a glance at the unconquerable maiden and Pallas Athena: – how muchpersonal timidity and vulnerability this sick hermit’s masquerade reveals!  I have gradually come to realize what every great philosophy so far hasbeen: a confession of faith on the part of its author, and a type of involun-tary and unself-conscious memoir; in short, that the moral (or immoral)intentions in every philosophy constitute the true living seed from whichthe whole plant has always grown. Actually , to explain how the strangestmetaphysical claims of a philosopher really come about, it is always good(and wise) to begin by asking: what morality is it (is he–) getting at? Con- sequently , I do not believe that a “drive for knowledge” is the father of ",613
Page 45,"On the prejudices of philosophers philosophy , but rather that another drive, here as elsewhere, used knowl- edge (and mis-knowledge!) merely as a tool. But anyone who looks atpeople’s basic drives, to see how far they may have played their little gameright here as inspiring geniuses (or daemons or sprites –), will ﬁnd that they all practiced philosophy at some point, – and that every single one of them would be only too pleased to present itself as the ultimate pur- pose of existence and as rightful master of all the other drives. Because every drive craves mastery , and this leads it to try philosophizing. – Of course: with scholars, the truly scientiﬁc people, things might be differ-ent – “better” if you will –, with them, there might really be something like a drive for knowledge, some independent little clockwork mechanism that, once well wound, ticks bravely away without essentially involving the rest of the scholar’s drives. For this reason, the scholar’s real “interests”usually lie somewhere else entirely , with the family , or earning money ,or in politics; in fact, it is almost a matter of indifference whether hislittle engine is put to work in this or that ﬁeld of research, and whetherthe “promising” young worker turns himself into a good philologist orfungus expert or chemist: – it doesn’t signify anything about him that he becomes one thing or the other. In contrast, there is absolutely nothingimpersonal about the philosopher; and in particular his morals bear de-cided and decisive witness to w h oh ei s – which means, in what order of rank the innermost drives of his nature stand with respect to each other.  How malicious philosophers can be! I do not know anything more ven-omous than the joke Epicurus allowed himself against Plato and thePlatonists: he called them Dionysiokolakes. Literally , the foreground meaning of this term is “sycophants of Dionysus” and therefore acces-sories of the tyrant and brown-nosers; but it also wants to say “they’reallactors , there’s nothing genuine about them” (since Dionysokolax was a popular term for an actor). And this second meaning is really the malicethat Epicurus hurled against Plato: he was annoyed by the magniﬁcentstyle, the mise-en-sc` ene that Plato and his students were so good at, – that Epicurus was not so good at!

Imagine something like nature, proﬂigate with-out measure, indifferent without measure, without purpose and regard,without mercy and justice, fertile and barren and uncertain at the sametime, think of indifference itself as power – how could you live according to this indifference? Living – isn’t that wanting specifically to be somethingother than this nature? Isn’t living assessing, preferring, being unfair,being limited, wanting to be different?

In rare and unusual cases, some sort of will to truthmight actually be at issue, some wild and adventurous streak of courage,a metaphysician’s ambition to hold on to a lost cause, that, in the end,will still prefer a handful of “certainty” to an entire wagonload of prettypossibilities. There might even be puritanical fanatics of conscience whowould rather lie dying on an assured nothing than an uncertain something.But this is nihilism, and symptomatic of a desperate soul in a state ofdeadly exhaustion, however brave such virtuous posturing may appear.With stronger, livelier thinkers, however, thinkers who still have a thirst forlife, things look different. By taking sides against appearance and speaking about “perspective” in a newly arrogant tone, by granting their own bodiesabout as little credibility as they grant the visual evidence that says “theearth stands still,” and so, with seemingly good spirits, relinquishing theirmost secure possession (since what do people believe in more securelythese days than their bodies?), who knows whether they are not basically trying to re-appropriate something that was once possessed even more securely , something from the old estate of a bygone faith, perhaps “the immortal soul” or perhaps “the old God,” in short, ideas that helped make life a bit better, which is to say stronger and more cheerful than“modern ideas” can do? There is a mistrust of these modern ideas here, there is a disbelief in everything built yesterday and today; perhaps it ismixed with a bit of antipathy and contempt that can no longer stand thebric-a-brac of concepts from the most heterogeneous sources, which is First cause. ",574
Page 48,"Beyond Good and Evil how so-called positivism puts itself on the market these days, a disgust felt by the more discriminating taste at the fun-fair colors and ﬂimsy scraps ofall these reality-philosophasters who have nothing new and genuine aboutthem except these colors. Here, I think, we should give these skepticalanti-realists and epistemo-microscopists their just due: the instinct thatdrives them away from modern reality is unassailable, – what do we care for their retrograde shortcut! The essential thing about them is not thatthey want to go “back”: but rather, that they want to get – away . A bit more strength, ﬂight, courage, artistry: and they would want to get up and out, – and not go back! –  It seems to me that people everywhere these days are at pains to divert attention away from the real inﬂuence Kant exerted over German phi-losophy , and, in particular, wisely to overlook the value he attributed tohimself. First and foremost, Kant was proud of his table of categories,  and he said with this table in his hands: “This is the hardest thing thatever could have been undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.” – But let usbe clear about this “could have been”! He was proud of having discovered a new faculty in humans, the faculty of synthetic judgments a priori .O f course he was deceiving himself here, but the development and rapidblossoming of German philosophy depended on this pride, and on thecompetitive zeal of the younger generation who wanted, if possible, to dis-cover something even prouder – and in any event “new faculties”! – But the time has come for us to think this over. How are synthetic judgmentsa priori possible ? Kant asked himself, – and what really was his answer? By virtue of a faculty , which is to say: enabled by an ability : unfortunately , though, not in these few words, but rather so laboriously , reverentially ,and with such an extravagance of German frills and profundity that peo-ple failed to hear the comical niaiserie allemande in such an answer. In fact, people were beside themselves with joy over this new faculty , andthe jubilation reached its peak when Kant discovered yet another faculty ,a moral faculty: – because the Germans were still moral back then, and The reference in this section is to Kant’s Kritik der reinen Vernunft (Critique of Pure Reason )( ,  ). In German: Verm ¨ oge eines Verm¨ ogens . German silliness. ",628

W e can do no greater in-justice to this whole high-spirited and enthusiastic movement (which wasjust youthfulness, however boldly it might have clothed itself in gray andhoary concepts) than to take it seriously or especially to treat it with moral indignation. Enough, we grew up, – the dream faded away . There camea time when people scratched their heads: some still scratch them to-day . There had been dreamers: ﬁrst and foremost – the old Kant. “By virtue of a faculty” – he had said, or at least meant. But is that really – ananswer? An explanation? Or instead just a repetition of the question? Sohow does opium cause sleep? “By virtue of a faculty ,” namely the virtus dormitiva – replies the doctor in Moli `ere, quia est in eo virtus dormitiva, cujus est natura sensus assoupire . But answers like this belong in comedy , and the time has ﬁnally come to replace the Kantian question “How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?” with another question, “Why is the belief in such judgmentsnecessary ?” – to realize, in other words, that such judgments must be believed true for the purpose of preserving beings of our type; which is why these judgments could of course still be false ! Or, to be blunt, basic and clearer still: synthetic judgments a priori do not have “to be possible” at all: we have no right to them, and in our mouths they arenothing but false judgments. It is only the belief in their truth that isnecessary as a foreground belief and piece of visual evidence, belongingto the perspectival optics of life. – And, ﬁnally , to recall the enormouseffect that “the German philosophy” – its right to these quotation marks A reference to Hegel, H ¨olderlin, and Schelling. In German: “‘ ﬁnden’ und ‘erﬁnden .’” “Because there is a dormative virtue in it / whose nature is to put the senses to sleep.” From Moli `ere’s Le Malade imaginaire (The Hypochondriac )( ). ",722

In Europe these days, nobody in the scholarly com-munity is likely to be so unscholarly as to attach any real signiﬁcance toit, except as a handy household tool (that is, as an abbreviated ﬁgure of speech). For this, we can thank that Pole, Boscovich, who, together withthe Pole, Copernicus, was the greatest, most successful opponent of thevisual evidence. While Copernicus convinced us to believe, contrary toall our senses, that the earth does not stand still, Boscovich taught us to renounce belief in the last bit of earth that did “stand still,” the belief in “matter,” in the “material,” in the residual piece of earth and clump of an atom: it was the greatest triumph over the senses that the world had everknown. – But we must go further still and declare wa r–ar uthless ﬁght to the ﬁnish – on the “atomistic need” that, like the more famous “meta-physical need,” still leads a dangerous afterlife in regions where nobodywould think to look. First of all, we must also put an end to that otherand more disastrous atomism, the one Christianity has taught best andlongest, the atomism of the soul . Let this expression signify the belief that the soul is something indestructible, eternal, indivisible, that it is a monad,anatomon :this belief must be thrown out of science! Between you and me, there is absolutely no need to give up “the soul” itself, and relinquishone of the oldest and most venerable hypotheses – as often happens with naturalists: given their clumsiness, they barely need to touch “the soul” to lose it. But the path lies open for new versions and sophistications ofthe soul hypothesis – and concepts like the “mortal soul” and the “soul assubject-multiplicity” and the “soul as a society constructed out of drives and affects” want henceforth to have civil rights in the realm of science.By putting an end to the superstition that until now has grown around theidea of the soul with an almost tropical luxuriance, the new psychologist clearly thrusts himself into a new wasteland and a new suspicion.

Above all, a living thing wants to discharge its strength – life itself is will to power –: self- preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent consequences of this. – In short, here as elsewhere, watch out for superﬂuous teleological principles! – such as the drive for preservation (which we owe to Spinoza’s inconsistency –). This is demanded by method, which must essentiallybe the economy of principles.  Now it is beginning to dawn on maybe ﬁve or six brains that physicstoo is only an interpretation and arrangement of the world (according toourselves! if I may say so) and not an explanation of the world. But to the extent that physics rests on belief in the senses, it passes for more, and willcontinue to pass for more, namely for an explanation, for a long time tocome. It has our eyes and our ﬁngers as its allies, it has visual evidence andtangibility as its allies. This helped it to enchant, persuade, convince an age with a basically plebeian taste – indeed, it instinctively follows thecanon of truth of the eternally popular sensualism. What is plain, what“explains”? Only what can be seen and felt, – this is as far as any problemhas to be pursued. Conversely: the strong attraction of the Platonic wayof thinking consisted in its opposition to precisely this empiricism. It was anoble way of thinking, suitable perhaps for people who enjoyed even stronger and more discriminating senses than our contemporaries, butwho knew how to ﬁnd a higher triumph in staying master over thesesenses. And they did this by throwing drab, cold, gray nets of conceptsover the brightly colored whirlwind of the senses – the rabble of thesenses, as Plato said. There was a type of enjoyment in overpowering Nietzsche is again making a pun by contrasting the terms Erﬁnden (invention) and Finden (discovery). Cf.Nomoi (Laws)  a–b. ",559

But I will saythis a hundred times: “immediate certainty ,” like “absolute knowledge” and the “thing in itself ” contains a contradictio in adjecto. For once and for all, we should free ourselves from the seduction of words! Let thepeople believe that knowing means knowing to the very end; the philoso-pher has to say: “When I dissect the process expressed in the proposition Reduction to an absurdity (contradiction). Cause of itself. Contradiction in terms. ",573
Page 53,"On the prejudices of philosophers ‘I think,’ I get a whole set of bold claims that are difﬁcult, perhaps impos- sible, to establish, – for instance, that Iam the one who is thinking, that there must be something that is thinking in the ﬁrst place, that thinking isan activity and the effect of a being who is considered the cause, that thereis an ‘I,’ and ﬁnally , that it has already been determined what is meant by thinking, – that I know what thinking is. Because if I had not already made up my mind what thinking is, how could I tell whether what hadjust happened was not perhaps ‘willing’ or ‘feeling’? Enough: this ‘I think’presupposes that I compare my present state with other states that I have seen in myself, in order to determine what it is: and because of this retro-spective comparison with other types of ‘knowing,’ this present state has absolutely no ‘immediate certainty’ for me.” – In place of that “imme-diate certainty” which may , in this case, win the faith of the people, the philosopher gets handed a whole assortment of metaphysical questions,genuinely probing intellectual questions of conscience, such as: “Wheredo I get the concept of thinking from? Why do I believe in causes andeffects? What gives me the right to speak about an I, and, for that mat-ter, about an I as cause, and, ﬁnally , about an I as the cause of thoughts?”Whoever dares to answer these metaphysical questions right away with anappeal to a sort of intuitive knowledge, like the person who says: “I think and know that at least this is true, real, certain” – he will ﬁnd the philoso-pher of today ready with a smile and two question-marks. “My dear sir,”the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand, “it is improbablethat you are not mistaken: but why insist on the truth?” –  As far as the superstitions of the logicians are concerned: I will not stopemphasizing a tiny little fact that these superstitious men are loath toadmit: that a thought comes when “it” wants, and not when “I” want. It is, therefore, a falsiﬁcation of the facts to say that the subject “I” is the condition of the predicate “think.” It thinks: but to say the “it” isjust that famous old “I” – well that is just an assumption or opinion, toput it mildly , and by no means an “immediate certainty .” In fact, thereis already too much packed into the “it thinks”: even the “it” containsaninterpretation of the process, and does not belong to the process itself. People are following grammatical habits here in drawing conclusions,reasoning that “thinking is an activity , behind every activity something is ",690
Page 54,"Beyond Good and Evil active, therefore –.” Following the same basic scheme, the older atomism looked behind every “force” that produces effects for that little lumpof matter in which the force resides, and out of which the effects areproduced, which is to say: the atom. More rigorous minds ﬁnally learnedhow to make do without that bit of “residual earth,” and perhaps one day even logicians will get used to making do without this little “it” (intowhich the honest old I has disappeared).  That a theory is refutable is, frankly , not the least of its charms: thisis precisely how it attracts the more reﬁned intellects. The theory of“free will,” which has been refuted a hundred times, appears to owe its endurance to this charm alone –: somebody will always come along andfeel strong enough to refute it.  Philosophers tend to talk about the will as if it were the most familiarthing in the world. In fact, Schopenhauer would have us believe that thewill is the only thing that is really familiar, familiar through and through,familiar without pluses or minuses. But I have always thought that, heretoo, Schopenhauer was only doing what philosophers always tend to do:adopting and exaggerating a popular prejudice . Willing strikes me as, above all, something complicated , something uniﬁed only in a word – and this single word contains the popular prejudice that has overruled whateverminimal precautions philosophers might take. So let us be more cautious,for once – let us be “unphilosophical.” Let us say: in every act of willing there is, to begin with, a plurality of feelings, namely: the feeling of thestate away from which , the feeling of the state towards which , and the feeling of this “away from” and “towards” themselves. But this is accompanied by a feeling of the muscles that comes into play through a sort of habitas soon as we “will,” even without our putting “arms and legs” intomotion. Just as feeling – and indeed many feelings – must be recognizedas ingredients of the will, thought must be as well. In every act of willthere is a commandeering thought, – and we really should not believethis thought can be divorced from the “willing,” as if some will wouldthen be left over! Third, the will is not just a complex of feeling and ",558
Page 55,"On the prejudices of philosophers thinking; rather, it is fundamentally an affect : and speciﬁcally the affect of the command. What is called “freedom of the will” is essentially the affect of superiority with respect to something that must obey: “I amfree, ‘it’ must obey” – this consciousness lies in every will, along with a certain straining of attention, a straight look that ﬁxes on one thingand one thing only , an unconditional evaluation “now this is necessaryand nothing else,” an inner certainty that it will be obeyed, and whateverelse comes with the position of the commander. A person who wills –, commands something inside himself that obeys, or that he believes toobey . But now we notice the strangest thing about the will – about thismultifarious thing that people have only one word for. On the one hand,we are, under the circumstances, both the one who commands and the one who obeys, and as the obedient one we are familiar with the feelingsof compulsion, force, pressure, resistance, and motion that generally startright after the act of willing. On the other hand, however, we are in thehabit of ignoring and deceiving ourselves about this duality by means ofthe synthetic concept of the “I.” As a result, a whole chain of erroneousconclusions, and, consequently , false evaluations have become attachedto the will, – to such an extent that the one who wills believes, in goodfaith, that willing sufﬁces for action. Since it is almost always the case that there is will only where the effect of command, and therefore obedience,and therefore action, may be expected , the appearance translates into the feeling, as if there were a necessity of effect . In short, the one who wills believes with a reasonable degree of certainty that will and action aresomehow one; he attributes the success, the performance of the willingto the will itself, and consequently enjoys an increase in the feeling ofpower that accompanies all success. “Freedom of the will” – that is theword for the multi-faceted state of pleasure of one who commands and, atthe same time, identiﬁes himself with the accomplished act of willing. Assuch, he enjoys the triumph over resistances, but thinks to himself that itwas his will alone that truly overcame the resistance. Accordingly , the onewho wills takes his feeling of pleasure as the commander, and adds to itthe feelings of pleasure from the successful instruments that carry out thetask, as well as from the useful “under-wills” or under-souls – our bodyis, after all, only a society constructed out of many souls –.

All willing is simply a matter of commanding and obeying,on the groundwork, as I have said, of a society constructed out of many“souls”: from which a philosopher should claim the right to understandwilling itself within the framework of morality: morality understood asa doctrine of the power relations under which the phenomenon of “life”arises. –  That individual philosophical concepts are not arbitrary and do not growup on their own, but rather grow in reference and relation to each other; that however suddenly and randomly they seem to emerge in the historyof thought, they still belong to a system just as much as all the membersof the fauna of a continent do: this is ultimately revealed by the certaintywith which the most diverse philosophers will always ﬁll out a deﬁnitebasic scheme of possible philosophies. Under an invisible spell, they will each start out anew , only to end up revolving in the same orbit once again.However independent of each other they might feel themselves to be, withtheir critical or systematic wills, something inside of them drives themon, something leads them into a particular order, one after the other, andthis something is precisely the innate systematicity and relationship ofconcepts. In fact, their thinking is not nearly as much a discovery as it isa recognition, remembrance, a returning and homecoming into a distant,primordial, total economy of the soul, from which each concept oncegrew: – to this extent, philosophizing is a type of atavism of the highest order. The strange family resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and Germanphilosophizing speaks for itself clearly enough. Where there are linguistic afﬁnities, then because of the common philosophy of grammar (I mean: due to the unconscious domination and direction through similar gram-matical functions), it is obvious that everything lies ready from the verystart for a similar development and sequence of philosophical systems;on the other hand, the way seems as good as blocked for certain otherpossibilities of interpreting the world. Philosophers of the Ural-Altaiclanguage group (where the concept of the subject is the most poorly de-veloped) are more likely to “see the world” differently , and to be found onpaths different from those taken by the Indo-Germans or Muslims: thespell of particular grammatical functions is in the last analysis the spell of ",538

But humanity’s excessive pride has got itself profoundly and horribly entangled with precisely this piece ofnonsense. The longing for “freedom of the will” in the superlative meta-physical sense (which, unfortunately , still rules in the heads of the half-educated), the longing to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility foryour actions yourself and to relieve God, world, ancestors, chance, and so-ciety of the burden – all this means nothing less than being that very causa suiand, with a courage greater than M ¨unchhausen’s, pulling yourself by the hair from the swamp of nothingness up into existence. Suppose some-one sees through the boorish naivet ´e of this famous concept of “free will” and manages to get it out of his mind; I would then ask him to carry his“enlightenment” a step further and to rid his mind of the reversal of thismisconceived concept of “free will”: I mean the “un-free will,” which is basically an abuse of cause and effect. W e should not erroneously objectify “cause” and “effect” like the natural scientists do (and whoever else thinksnaturalistically these days –) in accordance with the dominant mechanis-tic stupidity which would have the cause push and shove until it “effects”something; we should use “cause” and “effect” only as pure concepts , which is to say as conventional ﬁctions for the purpose of description andcommunication, not explanation. In the “in-itself ” there is nothing like “causal association,” “necessity ,” or “psychological un-freedom.” There, the “effect” does not follow “from the cause,” there is no rule of “law .” We are the ones who invented causation, succession, for-each-other, rel- ativity , compulsion, numbers, law , freedom, grounds, purpose; and if weproject and inscribe this symbol world onto things as an “in-itself,” thenthis is the way we have always done things, namely mythologically . The “un-free will” is mythology; in real life it is only a matter of strong and weak wills. It is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in a thinker when he senses some compulsion, need, having-to-follow , pressure, un-freedom in every “causal connection” and “psychological necessity .” It is Cause of itself. ",653
Page 58,"Beyond Good and Evil very telling to feel this way – the person tells on himself. And in general, if I have observed correctly , “un-freedom of the will” is regarded as a problem by two completely opposed parties, but always in a profoundlypersonal manner. The one party would never dream of relinquishing their “responsibility ,” a belief in themselves , a personal right to their own merit (the vain races belong to this group –). Those in the other party , on thecontrary , do not want to be responsible for anything or to be guilty ofanything; driven by an inner self-contempt, they long to be able to shift the blame for themselves to something else. When they write books these days, this latter group tends to side with the criminal; a type of socialistpity is their most attractive disguise. And, in fact, the fatalism of the weakof will starts to look surprisingly attractive when it can present itself as “la religion de la souffrance humaine ”: this is its“good taste.”  Y ou must forgive an old philologist like me who cannot help maliciously putting his ﬁnger on bad tricks of interpretation: but this “conformity ofnature to law ,” which you physicists are so proud of, just as if – – exists only because of your interpretation and bad “philology .” It is not a matterof fact, not a “text,” but instead only a naive humanitarian correction and a distortion of meaning that you use in order to comfortably accommodatethe democratic instincts of the modern soul! “Everywhere, equality beforethe law , – in this respect, nature is no different and no better off than we are”: a lovely case of ulterior motivation; and it serves once moreto disguise the plebeian antagonism against all privilege and autocracytogether with a second and more reﬁned atheism. “ Ni dieu, ni maˆ ıtre” – you want this too: and therefore “hurray for the laws of nature!” – right?But, as I have said, this is interpretation, not text; and somebody with anopposite intention and mode of interpretation could come along and beable to read from the same nature, and with reference to the same set ofappearances, a tyrannically ruthless and pitiless execution of power claims.This sort of interpreter would show the unequivocal and unconditionalnature of all “will to power” so vividly and graphically that almost every word, and even the word “tyranny ,” would ultimately seem useless orlike weakening and mollifying metaphors – and too humanizing.

Granted, this is only an interpretation too – and you willbe eager enough to make this objection? – well then, so much the better.  All psychology so far has been stuck in moral prejudices and fears: it hasnot ventured into the depths. To grasp psychology as morphology andthedoctrine of the development of the will to power , which is what I have done – nobody has ever come close to this, not even in thought: this, of course, to the extent that we are permitted to regard what has been written so far as a symptom of what has not been said until now . Thepower of moral prejudice has deeply affected the most spiritual world,which seems like the coldest world, the one most likely to be devoidof any presuppositions – and the effect has been manifestly harmful, hindering, dazzling, and distorting. A genuine physio-psychology has tocontend with unconscious resistances in the heart of the researcher, ithas “the heart” against it.

It’s just that, with this sort of wish we have tobe clear about what we will be seeing: – only a satyr-play , only a satirical epilogue, only the continuing proof that the long, real tragedy has come to an end (assuming that every philosophy was originally a long tragedy – ).  Every choice human being strives instinctively for a citadel and secrecy where he is rescued from the crowds, the many , the vast majority; where, as the exception, he can forget the human norm. The only exception iswhen he is driven straight towards this norm by an even stronger instinct,in search of knowledge in the great and exceptional sense. Anybody who,in dealing with people, does not occasionally glisten in all the shades ofdistress, green and gray with disgust, weariness, pity , gloominess, andloneliness – he is certainly not a person of higher taste. But if he does not freely take on all this effort and pain, if he keeps avoiding it and remains,as I said, placid and proud and hidden in his citadel, well then one thingis certain: he is not made for knowledge, not predestined for it. Becauseif he were, he would eventually have to say to himself: “To hell withgood taste! The norm is more interesting than the exception – than me,the exception!” – and he would wend his way downwards , and, above all, “inwards.” The long and serious study of the average man requires a great deal of disguise, self-overcoming, conﬁdentiality , bad company (all com-pany is bad company except with your equals); still, this is all a necessarypart of the life story of every philosopher, perhaps the least pleasant, mostfoul-smelling part and the one richest in disappointments. But if he islucky , as beﬁts knowledge’s child of fortune, the philosopher will ﬁnd real shortcuts and aids to make his work easier.

It seems as if the wrath andreverence that characterize youth will not rest easy until they have falsiﬁed people and things thoroughly enough to be able to vent themselves onthese targets. Y outh is itself intrinsically falsifying and deceitful. Later,after the young soul has been tortured by constant disappointments, itends up turning suspiciously on itself, still raging and wild, even in theforce of its suspicion and the pangs of its conscience. How furious itis with itself now , how impatiently it tears itself apart, what revenge itexacts for having blinded itself for so long, as if its blindness had beenvoluntary! In this transitional state, we punish ourselves by distrusting our feelings, we torture our enthusiasm with doubts, we experience even a good conscience as a danger, as if it were a veil wrapped around us,something marking the depletion of a more subtle, genuine honesty . And,above all, we become partisan, partisan on principle against “youth.” – A decade later, we realize that all this – was youthfulness too!  During the longest epoch of human history (which is called the prehistoricage) an action’s value or lack of value was derived from its consequences;the action itself was taken as little into account as its origin. Instead,the situation was something like that of present-day China, where thehonor or dishonor of a child reﬂects back on the parents. In the sameway , it was the retroactive force of success or failure that showed peo-ple whether to think of an action as good or bad. W e can call this pe-riod the pre-moral period of humanity . At that point, the imperative “know thyself !” was still unknown. By contrast, over the course of the lastten millennia, people across a large part of the earth have gradually comefar enough to see the origin, not the consequence, as decisive for thevalue of an action. By and large, this was a great event, a consider-able reﬁnement of outlook and criterion, an unconscious after-effect of thedominance of aristocratic values and the belief in “origin,” and the sign of a period that we can signify as moral in a narrow sense. This marks the ﬁrst attempt at self-knowledge. Origin rather than consequence: what areversal of perspective! And, certainly , this reversal was only accomplishedafter long struggles and ﬂuctuations! Granted: this meant that a disastrous ",595
Page 69,"The free spirit new superstition, a distinctive narrowness of interpretation gained domi- nance. The origin of the action was interpreted in the most determinatesense possible, as origin out of an intention . People were united in the be- lief that the value of an action was exhausted by the value of its intention.Intention as the entire origin and prehistory of an action: under this pre-judice people have issued moral praise, censure, judgment, and philoso-phy almost to this day . – But today , thanks to a renewed self-contemplationand deepening of humanity , shouldn’t we be facing a renewed necessityto effect a reversal and fundamental displacement of values? Shouldn’twe be standing on the threshold of a period that would be designated,negatively at ﬁrst, as extra-moral ? Today , when we immoralists, at least, suspect that the decisive value is conferred by what is speciﬁcally unin- tentional about an action, and that all its intentionality , everything about it that can be seen, known, or raised to “conscious awareness,” only be- longs to its surface and skin – which, like every skin, reveals somethingbutconceals even more? In short, we believe that the intention is only a sign and symptom that ﬁrst needs to be interpreted, and that, moreover,it is a sign that means too many things and consequently means almostnothing by itself. W e believe that morality in the sense it has had up to now(the morality of intentions) was a prejudice, a precipitousness, perhapsa preliminary , a thing on about the same level as astrology and alchemy ,but in any case something that must be overcome. The overcoming ofmorality – even the self-overcoming of morality , in a certain sense: let this be the name for that long and secret labor which is reserved for the mostsubtle, genuinely honest, and also the most malicious consciences of theday , who are living touchstones of the soul. –  There is nothing else to be done: the feelings of utter devotion, of sacriﬁcefor your neighbor, and the entire morality of self-abnegation have tobe mercilessly taken to court and made to account for themselves. Andthe same holds for the aesthetic of “disinterested contemplation,” theseductive guise under which the castration of art is presently trying tocreate a good conscience for itself. These feelings of “for others,” of“not for myself,” contain far too much sugar and sorcery for us not to need to become doubly suspicious here and ask: “ Aren’t these perhaps –seductions ?” To say that these feelings are pleasing (for the one who has ",608
Page 70,"Beyond Good and Evil them, for the one who enjoys their fruits, and even for the mere onlooker) is not yet an argument in their favor , but rather constitutes a demand for caution. So let us be cautious!  It does not matter what philosophical standpoint you might take thesedays: any way you look at it, the erroneousness of the world we think we live in is the most certain and solid fact that our eyes can still grab hold of.W e ﬁnd reason after reason for it, reasons that might lure us into specu-lations about a deceptive principle in “the essence of things.” But anyonewho makes thinking itself (and therefore “the spirit”) responsible for thefalseness of the world (an honorable way out, taken by every conscious orunconscious advocatus dei ), anyone who considers this world, together with space, time, form, and motion, to be falsely inferred – such a person would at the very least have ample cause to grow suspicious of think-ing altogether. Hasn’t it played the biggest joke on us to date? And whatguarantee would there be that it wouldn’t keep doing what it has alwaysdone? In all seriousness, there is something touching and awe-inspiringabout the innocence that, to this day , lets a thinker place himself in frontof consciousness with the request that it please give him honest answers: for example, whether or not it is “real,” and why it so resolutely keepsthe external world at arm’s length, and other questions like that. Thebelief in “immediate certainties” is a moral naivet ´e that does credit to us philosophers: but – we should stop being “merely moral,” for once! Aside from morality , the belief in immediate certainties is a stupidity that doesus little credit! In bourgeois life, a suspicious disposition might be a sign of“bad character” and consequently considered unwise. But here with us,beyond the bourgeois sphere with its Y eses and Noes, – what is to stop us from being unwise and saying: “ As the creature who has been the biggestdupe the earth has ever seen, the philosopher pretty much has a right to a ‘bad character.’ It is his duty to be suspicious these days, to squint as maliciously as possible out of every abyss of mistrust.” – Forgive me forplaying jokes with this gloomy grimace and expression: because when itcomes to betrayal and being betrayed, I myself learned a long time ago tothink differently and evaluate differently; and my elbow is ready with at Advocate of God (as opposed to the devil’s advocate). ",601

It is no more than a moral prejudice that the truth is worth more than appearance; in fact, it is the world’s mostpoorly proven assumption. Let us admit this much: that life could not ex-ist except on the basis of perspectival valuations and appearances; and if,with the virtuous enthusiasm and inanity of many philosophers, someonewanted to completely abolish the “world of appearances,” – well, assum- ingyou could do that, – at least there would not be any of your “truth” left either! Actually , why do we even assume that “true” and “false” are intrinsically opposed? Isn’t it enough to assume that there are levels ofappearance and, as it were, lighter and darker shades and tones of appear-ance – different valeurs , to use the language of painters? Why shouldn’t the world that is relevant to us – be a ﬁction? And if someone asks: “But doesn’t ﬁction belong with an author?” – couldn’t we shoot back: “ Why? Doesn’t this ‘belonging’ belong, perhaps, to ﬁction as well? Aren’t weallowed to be a bit ironic with the subject, as we are with the predicateand object? Shouldn’t philosophers rise above the belief in grammar?With all due respect to governesses, isn’t it about time philosophy re-nounced governess-beliefs?” –  O V oltaire! O humanity! O nonsense! There is something to “truth,” tothesearch for truth; and when a human being is too humane about it – when “ il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien ” – I bet he won’t ﬁnd anything!  Assuming that our world of desires and passions is the only thing “given”as real, that we cannot get down or up to any “reality” except the reality ofour drives (since thinking is only a relation between these drives) – aren’t we allowed to make the attempt and pose the question as to whethersomething like this “given” isn’t enough to render the so-called mecha- nistic (and thus material) world comprehensible as well?

W e would be able to understand the mecha-nistic world as a kind of life of the drives, where all the organic functions(self-regulation, assimilation, nutrition, excretion, and metabolism) arestill synthetically bound together – as a pre-form of life? – In the end, we are not only allowed to make such an attempt: the conscience of method demands it. Multiple varieties of causation should not be postulated until the attempt to make do with a single one has been taken as far as it willgo (– ad absurdum , if you will). This is a moral of method that cannot be escaped these days; – it follows “from the deﬁnition,” as a mathematician would say . The question is ultimately whether we recognize the will as, ineffect, efﬁcacious , whether we believe in the causality of the will. If we do (and this belief is really just our belief in causality itself –), then we must make the attempt to hypothetically posit the causality of the will as theonly type of causality there is. “Will” can naturally have effects only on“will” – and not on “matter” (not on “nerves” for instance –). Enough: we must venture the hypothesis that everywhere “effects” are recognized,will is effecting will – and that every mechanistic event in which a forceis active is really a force and effect of the will. – Assuming, ﬁnally , thatwe succeeded in explaining our entire life of drives as the organizationand outgrowth of one basic form of will (namely , of the will to power,which is myclaim); assuming we could trace all organic functions back to this will to power and ﬁnd that it even solved the problem of procreationand nutrition (which is a single problem); then we will have earned theright to clearly designate allefﬁcacious force as: will to power . The world seen from inside, the world determined and described with respect to its“intelligible character” – would be just this “will to power” and nothingelse. –  “What?

In the same way , a noble posterity could again misunderstand the entire past, and in so doing, perhaps, begin to makeit tolerable to look at. – Or rather: hasn’t this happened already? weren’twe ourselves this “noble posterity”? And right now , since we’re realizingthis to be the case – hasn’t it stopped being so?  No one would consider a doctrine to be true just because it makes peoplehappy or virtuous, with the possible exception of the darling “Idealists,”who wax enthusiastic over the Good, the True, and the Beautiful, and letall sorts of colorful, clumsy , and good-natured desiderata swim through their pond in utter confusion. Happiness and virtue are not arguments.But we like to forget (even thoughtful spirits like to forget) that being madeunhappy and evil are not counter-arguments either.

But there is no doubtthat when it comes to discovering certain aspects of the truth, people who are evil and unhappy are more fortunate and have a greater probabilityof success (not to mention those who are both evil and happy – a species that the moralists don’t discuss).

W ouldn’t just the opposite be a proper disguise for the shame of a god? A questionable questio n: it would be odd if some mystic hadn’t already risked something similar himself. There are events that are so delicate that it is best to cover them up with some coarsenessand make them unrecognizable. There are acts of love and extravagantgenerosity in whose aftermath nothing is more advisable than to take astick and give the eye-witnesses a good beating: this will obscure anymemory traces. Many people are excellent at obscuring and abusing theirown memory , so they can take revenge on at least this one accessory: –shame is highly resourceful. It is not the worst things that we are the mostashamed of. Malicious cunning is not the only thing behind a mask –there is so much goodness in cunning. I could imagine that a man withsomething precious and vulnerable to hide would roll through life, roughand round like an old, green, heavy-hooped wine cask; the subtlety of hisshame will want it this way . A man with something profound in his shameencounters even his fate and delicate decisions along paths that few peoplehave ever found, paths whose existence must be concealed from his closestand most trusted friends. His mortal danger is hidden from their eyes,and so is his regained sense of conﬁdence in life. Somebody hidden in thisway – who instinctively needs speech in order to be silent and concealed, and is tireless in evading communication – wants and encourages a mask of himself to wander around, in his place, through the hearts and heads ofhis friends. And even if this is not what he wants, he will eventually realizethat a mask of him has been there all the same, – and that this is for the best. “To be a good philosopher you have to be dry , clear, and without illusions.

Not to be stuck in any homeland, even the neediest and most oppressed – it is not as hardto tear your heart away from a victorious homeland. Not to be stuck insome pity: even for higher men, whose rare torture and helplessness weourselves have accidentally glimpsed.

From what I can guess about them,from what they allow to be guessed (since it is typical of them to want to remain riddles in some respect), these philosophers of the future mighthave the right (and perhaps also the wrong) to be described as those who attempt . Ultimately , this name is itself only an attempt, and, if you will, a temptation. In German: Versucher .

But they certainlywill not be dogmatists. It would offend their pride, as well as their taste, iftheir truth were a truth for everyone (which has been the secret wish andhidden meaning of all dogmatic aspirations so far). “My judgment is my judgment: other people don’t have an obvious right to it too” – perhapsthis is what such a philosopher of the future will say . W e must do away withthe bad taste of wanting to be in agreement with the majority . “Good”is no longer good when it comes from your neighbor’s mouth. And howcould there ever be a “common good”! The term is self-contradictory:whatever can be common will never have much value. In the end, it has tobe as it is and has always been: great things are left for the great, abyssesfor the profound, delicacy and trembling for the subtle, and, all in all,everything rare for those who are rare themselves. –  After all this, do I really need to add that they will be free, very free spirits, these philosophers of the future – and that they certainly will notjust be free spirits, but rather something more, higher, greater, and funda- mentally different, something that does not want to be misunderstoodor mistaken for anything else? But, in saying this, I feel – towards themalmost as much as towards ourselves (who are their heralds and precursors,we free spirits!) – an obligation to sweep away a stupid old prejudice and misunderstanding about all of us that has hung like a fog aroundthe concept of the “free spirit” for far too long, leaving it completely opaque. In all the countries of Europe, and in America as well, there isnow something that abuses this name: a very narrow , restricted, chained-up type of spirit whose inclinations are pretty much the opposite of ourown intentions and instincts (not to mention the fact that this restrictedtype will be a fully shut window and bolted door with respect to theseapproaching new philosophers). In a word (but a bad one): they belong to thelevelers , these misnamed “free spirits” – as eloquent and proliﬁcally scribbling slaves of the democratic taste and its “modern ideas.” Theyare all people without solitude, without their own solitude, clumsy , solidfolks whose courage and honest decency cannot be denied – it’s just thatthey are un-free and ridiculously superﬁcial, particularly given their basic ",588

To no avail: time and again he gets an ample and bitter reminder of how hard it is to ﬁnd hounds and helpers for the very thingsthat prick his curiosity . The problem with sending scholars into new anddangerous hunting grounds, where courage, intelligence, and subtlety inevery sense are needed, is that they stop being useful the very moment the“great hunt” (but also the great danger) begins: – this is just when they lose their sharp eye and keen nose. For instance, it might take somebody whois himself as deep, as wounded, and as monstrous as Pascal’s intellectualconscience to ﬁgure out the sort of history that the problem of science and conscience has had in the soul of homines religiosi so far.

It is much closer to Pascal’s faith, which hasthe gruesome appearance of a protracted suicide of reason – a tough, long-lived, worm-like reason that cannot be killed all at once and with a singlestroke. From the beginning, Christian faith has been sacriﬁce: sacriﬁce ofall freedom, of all pride, of all self-conﬁdence of the spirit; it is simultane-ously enslavement and self-derision, self-mutilation. There is cruelty andreligious Phoenicianism in this faith, which is expected of a worn-down,many-sided, badly spoiled conscience. Its presupposition is that the subju-gation of spirit causes indescribable pain , and that the entire past and all the habits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum presented to it as “faith.” Obtuse to all Christian terminology , modern people can no longer relateto the hideous superlative found by an ancient taste in the paradoxicalformula “god on the cross.” Nowhere to date has there been such a boldinversion or anything quite as horrible, questioning, and questionable asthis formula. It promised a revaluation of all the values of antiquity . –This was the revenge of the Orient, the deep Orient, this was the revenge of the oriental slave on Rome with its noble and frivolous tolerance, onRoman “Catholicity” of faith. And what infuriated the slaves about andagainst their masters was never faith itself, but rather the freedom fromfaith, that half-stoic and smiling nonchalance when it came to the serious-ness of faith.

This last doubt seems justiﬁed by the fact that another one of the most regularsymptoms of the religious neurosis, in both wild and tame peoples, is themost sudden and dissipated display of voluptuousness, which then turnsjust as suddenly into spasms of repentance and negations of the worldand will: perhaps both can be interpreted as epilepsy in disguise? Buthere is where interpretation must be resisted the most: no type to datehas been surrounded by such an overgrowth of inanity and superstition;and none so far has seemed to hold more interest for people, or even forphilosophers.

How isnegation of the will possible ? How is the saint possible? This really seems to have been the question that started Schopenhauer off and made him intoa philosopher. And so it was a true Schopenhauerian consequence that hismost devoted follower (and perhaps also his last, as far as Germany wasconcerned –), namely Richard Wagner, ﬁnished his own life’s work at thisvery point, and ﬁnally brought to the stage the life and times of that awfuland eternal type in the character of Kundry , type v´ ecu. And, at the same time, psychiatrists in almost every European country had the opportunityto study this type up close, wherever the religious neurosis – or, as I callit, “the religious character” – was having its latest epidemic outbreak and A type that has lived.

It seemed palpable that here was a “bad man” turning suddenly into a good man, a “saint.” Psychology to date has been shipwreckedon this spot.

They sensed a supe-rior force in the saint and, as it were, behind the question-mark of hisfrail and pathetic appearance, a force that wants to test itself through this sort of conquest. They sensed a strength of will in which theycould recognize and honor their own strength and pleasure in domi- nation. When they honored the saint, they honored something in them-selves. Furthermore, the sight of the saint made them suspicious: “Noone would desire such a monstrosity of negation, of anti-nature, fornothing,” they said to (and asked of) themselves. “Perhaps there is areason for it, perhaps the ascetic has inside information about some verygreat danger, thanks to his secret counselors and visitors?” Enough: infront of the saint, the powerful of the world learned a new fear, theysensed a new power, an alien, still unconquered enemy: – it was the “will to power” that made them stop in front of the saint.

The fact that this New ",545

God “the Father” has been thoroughly refuted;and so has “the Judge” and “the Reward-giver.” The same for God’s “free will”: he doesn’t listen, – and even if he did, he wouldn’t know how to help anyway . The worst part of it is: he seems unable to communicatein an intelligible manner: is he unclear? – After hearing, questioning, dis- cussing many things, these are the causes I have found for the decline ofEuropean theism. It seems to me that the religious instinct is indeed grow-ing vigorously – but that it rejects any speciﬁcally theistic gratiﬁcationwith profound distrust.  So what is really going on with the whole of modern philosophy? SinceDescartes (and, in fact, in spite of him more than because of him) allthe philosophers have been out to assassinate the old concept of the soul,under the guise of critiquing the concepts of subject and predicate. In otherwords, they have been out to assassinate the fundamental presuppositionof the Christian doctrine. As a sort of epistemological skepticism, modernphilosophy is, covertly or overtly , anti-Christian (although, to state the point for more subtle ears, by no means anti-religious). People used tobelieve in “the soul” as they believed in grammar and the grammatical subject: people said that “I” was a condition and “think” was a predicateand conditioned – thinking is an activity , and a subject must be thought of as its cause. Now , with admirable tenacity and cunning, people arewondering whether they can get out of this net – wondering whether the reverse might be true: that “think” is the condition and “I” is conditioned, in which case “I” would be a synthesis that only gets produced through thought itself. Kant essentially wanted to prove that the subject cannot be proven on the basis of the subject – and neither can the object. Thepossibility that the subject (and therefore “the soul”) has a merely apparent existence might not always have been foreign to him, this thought that, ",574

People used to make human sacriﬁces to theirgod, perhaps even sacriﬁcing those they loved the best – this sort of phe-nomenon can be found in the sacriﬁce of the ﬁrstborn (a practice sharedby all prehistoric religions), as well as in Emperor Tiberius ’ sacriﬁce in the Mithras grotto on the Isle of Capri, that most gruesome of all Romananachronisms. Then, during the moral epoch of humanity , people sacri-ﬁced the strongest instincts they had, their “nature,” to their god; the joyofthis particular festival shines in the cruel eyes of the ascetic, that enthu- siastic piece of “anti-nature.” Finally: what was left to be sacriﬁced? In theend, didn’t people have to sacriﬁce all comfort and hope, everything holyor healing, any faith in a hidden harmony or a future ﬁlled with justiceand bliss? Didn’t people have to sacriﬁce God himself and worship rocks,stupidity , gravity , fate, or nothingness out of sheer cruelty to themselves?To sacriﬁce God for nothingness – that paradoxical mystery of the ﬁnalcruelty has been reserved for the race that is now approaching: by nowwe all know something about this. –  Anyone like me, who has tried for a long time and with some enigmaticdesire, to think pessimism through to its depths and to deliver it fromthe half-Christian, half-German narrowness and naivet ´e with which it has ﬁnally presented itself to this century , namely in the form of theSchopenhauerian philosophy; anyone who has ever really looked with anAsiatic and supra-Asiatic eye into and down at the most world-negatingof all possible ways of thinking – beyond good and evil, and no longer, likeSchopenhauer and the Buddha, under the spell and delusion of morality –;anyone who has done these things (and perhaps precisely bydoing these things) will have inadvertently opened his eyes to the inverse ideal: to theideal of the most high-spirited, vital, world-afﬁrming individual, who haslearned not just to accept and go along with what was and what is, but whowants it again just as it was and is through all eternity , insatiably shouting ",613

Perhaps everything the mind’s eye has used to quickenits wit and deepen its understanding was really just a chance to practice,a piece of fun, something for children and childish people. Perhaps theday will come when the concepts of “God” and “sin,” which are the most solemn concepts of all and have caused the most ﬁghting and suffering,will seem no more important to us than a child’s toy and a child’s painseem to an old man, – and perhaps “the old man” will then need anothertoy and another pain, – still enough of a child, an eternal child!  Has anyone really noticed the extent to which being outwardly idle orhalf-idle is necessary for a genuinely religious life (and for its favorite jobof microscopic self-examination just as much as for that tender state ofcomposure which calls itself “prayer” and is a constant readiness for the“coming of God”) ?–Im e a na n idleness with a good conscience, passed down over the ages, through the bloodline, an idleness that is not entirelyalien to the aristocratic feeling that work is disgraceful , which is to say it makes the soul and the body into something base.

They feel they are already busy enough, these good people,whether it is with their businesses or their pleasures, not to mention the“fatherland” and the newspapers and “familial obligations.” They do not seem to have any time to spare for religion, particularly when it is unclearto them whether it would be a new business or a new pleasure – “sincepeople can’t possibly be going to church just to spoil a good mood,” theytell themselves. They are not enemies of religious customs; if circumstance (or the state) requires them to take part in such customs, they do whatis required, like people tend to do –, and they do it with a patient and unassuming earnestness, without much in the way of curiosity or unease:they just live too far apart and outside to even think they need a For orAgainst in such matters. Today , most middle-class German Protestantsare also among the ranks of the indifferent, particularly in the industriouslarge trade and transportation centers; the same is true for the majority ofindustrious scholars, and the whole university apparatus (except for thetheologians, whose presence and possibility here gives the psychologistincreasingly many and increasingly subtle riddles to resolve). People whoare devout or even just church-goers will rarely imagine how much goodwill (or may be “whimsical will”) is required for a German scholar to take the problem of religion seriously . On the basis of his whole craft (and, asmentioned before, on the basis of the craftsman-like industriousness hismodern conscience commits him to), he tends to regard religion with an airof superior, almost gracious amusement, which is sometimes mixed with aslight contempt for what he assumes to be an “uncleanliness” of spirit thatexists wherever anyone still supports the church. Only with the help ofhistory (and therefore noton the basis of his personal experience) does the scholar succeed in approaching religion with a reverential seriousness anda certain cautious consideration. But even if he reaches the point wherehe feels grateful for religion, he does not come a single step closer to whatstill passes for church or piety: possibly even the reverse. The practicalindifference towards religious matters with which he was born and raisedtends, in his case, to be sublimated into a caution and cleanliness that shunscontact with religious people and religious affairs; and it can be the verydepth of his tolerance and humanity that urges him to evade the subtle ",605

Perhaps piety has been the mostpotent method yet for the beautiﬁcation of humanity: it can turn peopleinto art, surface, plays of colors, benevolence, and to such an extent thatwe can ﬁnally look at them without suffering. – Religious people. ",589
Page 90,"Beyond Good and Evil  To love humanity for the sake of God – that has been the noblest and most bizarre feeling people have attained so far. That the love of humanity , inthe absence of any sanctifying ulterior motive, is one more stupidity and abomination; that the tendency to love humanity like this can only getits standard, its subtlety , its grain of salt and pinch of ambergris from a higher tendency: – whoever it was that ﬁrst felt and “experienced” allthis, however much his tongue might have stumbled as it tried to expresssuch a tenderness, let him be forever holy and admirable to us as the manwho has ﬂown the highest so far and has got the most beautifully lost!  The philosopher as weunderstand him, we free spirits –, as the man with the most comprehensive respo nsibility , whose conscience bears the weight of the overall development of humanity , this philosopher will make use of religion for his breeding and education work, just as he will make useof the prevailing political and economic situation. The inﬂuence that canbe exerted over selection and breeding with the help of religions (and thisinﬂuence is always just as destructive as it is creative and formative) variesaccording to the type of person who falls under their spell and protec-tion. For people who are strong, independent, prepared, and predestinedfor command, people who come to embody the reason and art of a gov-erning race, religion is an additional means of overcoming resistances,of being able to rule. It binds the ruler together with the ruled, givingand handing the consciences of the ruled over to the rulers – which is tosay: handing over their hidden and most interior aspect, and one whichwould very much like to escape obedience. And if individuals from sucha noble lineage are inclined, by their high spirituality , towards a retiringand contemplative life, reserving for themselves only the ﬁnest sorts ofrule (over exceptional young men or monks), then religion can even beused as a means of securing calm in the face of the turmoil and tribu-lations of the cruder forms of government, and purity in the face of the necessary dirt of politics. This is how the Brahmins, for instance, un- derstood the matter. With the help of a religious organization, they as-sumed the power to appoint kings for the people, while they themselveskept and felt removed and outside, a people of higher, over-kingly tasks. ",552
Page 91,"The religious character Meanwhile, religion also gives some fraction of the ruled the instruction and opportunity they need to prepare for eventual rule and command.This is particularly true for that slowly ascending class and station inwhich, through fortunate marriage practices, the strength and joy of thewill, the will to self-control is always on the rise. Religion tempts and urgesthem to take the path to higher spirituality and try out feelings of greatself-overcoming, of silence, and of solitude. Asceticism and Puritanismare almost indispensable means of educating and ennobling a race thatwants to gain control over its origins among the rabble, and work its wayup to eventual rule. Finally , as for the common people, the great majority ,who exist and are only allowed to exist to serve and to be of general utility , religion gives them an invaluable sense of contentment with theirsituation and type; it puts their hearts greatly at ease, it gloriﬁes theirobedience, it gives them (and those like them) one more happiness and onemore sorrow , it transﬁgures and improves them, it provides somethingof a justiﬁcation for everything commonplace, for all the lowliness, forthe whole half-bestial poverty of their souls. Religion, and the meaningreligion gives to life, spreads sunshine over such eternally tormentedpeople and makes them bearable even to themselves. It has the sameeffect that an Epicurean philosophy usually has on the suffering of higherranks: it refreshes, reﬁnes, and makes the most of suffering, as it were. In the end it even sanctiﬁes and justiﬁes. Perhaps there is nothing morevenerable about Christianity and Buddhism than their art of teachingeven the lowliest to use piety in order to situate themselves in an illusoryhigher order of things, and in so doing stay satisﬁed with the actual order,in which their lives are hard enough (in which precisely this hardness isnecessary!).  Finally , to show the downside of these religions as well and throw lighton their uncanny dangers: there is a high and horrible price to pay whenreligions do notserve as means for breeding and education in the hands of a philosopher, but instead serve themselves and become sovereign , when they want to be the ultimate goal instead of a means alongside other means.With humans as with every other type of animal, there is a surplus of fail-ures and degenerates, of the diseased and inﬁrm, of those who necessarilysuffer. Even with humans, successful cases are always the exception and, ",570
Page 92,"Beyond Good and Evil since humans are the still undetermined animals , the infrequent exception. But it gets worse: people who represent more nobly bred types are lesslikely to turn out well . Chance, that law of nonsense in the overall economy of mankind, is most terribly apparent in its destructive effect on the highermen, whose conditions of life are subtle, multiple, and difﬁcult to calcu-late. So how is this surplus of failures treated by the two greatest religions, those mentioned above? They try to preserve, to keep everything livingthat can be kept in any way alive. In fact, they take sides with the failuresas a matter of principle, as religions of the suffering . They give rights to all those who suffer life like a disease, and they want to make every otherfeeling for life seem wrong and become impossible. Whatever merit wemight ﬁnd in this indulgent, preserving care, which was and is meant for the highest types of people (since these are the ones that, historically , have almost always suffered the most), along with everyone else – nevertheless,in the ﬁnal analysis, the religions that have existed so far (which have allbeen sovereign ) have played a principal role in keeping the type “man” on a lower level. They have preserved too much of what should be destroyed . They have done invaluable service, these religions, and who is so richlyendowed with gratitude not to grow poor in the face of everything that, forinstance, the “spiritual men” of Christianity have done for Europe so far! And yet, after they gave comfort to the suffering, courage to the oppressedand despairing, a staff and support to the dependent, after they found peo-ple who were inwardly destroyed or had grown wild and lured them awayfrom society , into cloisters and spiritual prisons: what else did they haveto do, to work in good conscience and conviction for the preservationof all the sick and suffering, which really means working in word andin deed for the deterioration of the European race ? Stand all valuations on their head –that is what they had to do! And crush the strong, strike down the great hopes, throw suspicion on the delight in beauty , skew every-thing self-satisﬁed, manly , conquering, domineering, every instinct thatbelongs to the highest and best-turned-out type of “human,” twist theminto uncertainty , crisis of conscience, self-destruction; at the limit, invertthe whole love of the earth and of earthly dominion into hatred againstearth and the earthly – that is the task the church set and needed to set for itself until, in its estimation, “unworldly ,” “unsensuous,” and “higherman” ﬁnally melted together into a single feeling.

Considering what it signiﬁes, the very phrase “science of morals”is much too arrogant and offends good taste, which always tends to prefer more modest terms. W e should admit to ourselves with all due sever-ity exactly what will be necessary for a long time to come and what is provisionally correct, namely: collecting material, formulating concepts,and putting into order the tremendous realm of tender value feelings andvalue distinctions that live, grow , reproduce, and are destroyed, – and,perhaps, attempting to illustrate the recurring and more frequent shapesof this living crystallization, – all of which would be a preparation for atypology of morals. Of course, people have not generally been this modest. Philosophers have all demanded (with ridiculously stubborn seriousness)something much more exalted, ambitious, and solemn as soon as theytook up morality as a science: they wanted morality to be grounded ,– and every philosopher so far has thought that he has provided a groundfor morality . Morality itself, however, was thought to be “given.” Whata distance between this sort of crass pride and that supposedly modestlittle descriptive project, left in rot and ruin, even though the subtlesthands and senses could hardly be subtle enough for it.

As strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself has beenmissing from every “science of morals” so far: there was no suspicion that anything was really a problem. Viewed properly , the “grounding ofmorals” (as philosophers called it, as they demanded it of themselves) wasonly an erudite form of good faith in the dominant morality , a new way ofexpressing it; as such, it was itself already situated within the terms of a certain morality . In the last analysis, it even constitutes a type of denialthat these morals can be regarded as a problem. But, in any event, it is the opposite of an examination, dissection, interrogation, vivisection of pre-cisely this article of faith. For example, let us listen to the almost admirableinnocence with which even Schopenhauer describes his own project, andthen we can draw our conclusions as to how scientiﬁc a “science” could be when its ultimate masters are still talking like children or old women.“The principle,” he says (p.  of the Grundprobleme der Moral ), “the fundamental claim, on whose content all ethicists actually agree: neminem laede, immo omnes, quantum potes, juva – this is actually the claim that all moralists attempt to ground ...theactual foundation of ethics that people have sought for millennia, just as they have looked for the philoso-phers’ stone.” – The difﬁculty involved in grounding the claim just cited might be great indeed – Schopenhauer himself came up famously shortin this regard. And anyone who has ever truly felt how inanely false andsentimental this claim is in a world whose essence is will to power –, they might recall that Schopenhauer, pessimism notwithstanding, actu- ally – played the ﬂute ...every day , after dinner. Y ou can read it in his biography . And just out of curiosity: a pessimist who negates both Godand world but stops before morality , – who afﬁrms morality and plays his ﬂute, afﬁrms laede neminem morality: excuse me? is this really – a pessimist? Spirit of the age. “Harm no one, but rather help everyone as much as you can.” Schopenhauer’s “Preisschrift ¨uber die Grundlage der Moral” (Prize Essay on the Basis of Morals), part two of Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik (The Two Fundamental Problems of Ethics )( ).

Page 113,"On the natural history of morals  Apart from the value of claims like “there is a categorical imperative in us,” the question remains: what do claims like this tell us about the peoplewho make them? There are moralities that are supposed to justify theircreator in the eyes of others, and other moralities that are supposed to calmhim down and allow him to be content with himself; still other moralitiesallow him to crucify and humiliate himself. He can use some moralitiesto take revenge, others to hide, and still others to transﬁgure himself andplace himself far and away . There are moralities that help their creator toforget, and others that let him – or something about him – be forgotten.Many moralists would like to wield power and impose their creative whimson humanity; many others (perhaps even Kant himself) want to make itclear through their morality that “the worthy thing about me is that I canobey – and it should be the same for you as it is for me!” – in short, even morality is just a sign language of the affects !  Every morality , as opposed to laisser-aller ,is a piece of tyranny against both “nature” and “reason.” But this in itself is no objection; for that,we would have to issue yet another decree based on some other moral-ity forbidding every sort of tyranny and unreason. What is essential andinvaluable about every morality is that it is a long compulsion. In orderto understand Stoicism or Port-Royal or Puritanism, just remember thecompulsion under which every language so far has developed strengthand freedom: the compulsion of meter, the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm.Look at how much trouble the poets and the orators of every countryhave to go through! (including some of today’s prose writers, who havean inexorable conscience in their ear) – and all “for the sake of some stu-pidity ,” as utilitarian fools say (and think they are clever for saying it) – or“in obsequious submission to arbitrary laws,” as anarchists say (and thenimagine themselves “free,” even free-spirited). But the strange fact isthat everything there is, or was, of freedom, subtlety , boldness, dance, ormasterly assurance on earth, whether in thinking itself, or in ruling, or inspeaking and persuading, in artistic just as in ethical practices, has onlydeveloped by virtue of the “tyranny of such arbitrary laws.” And, in all Letting go. ",588

Every artist knows how far removed this feeling of letting go is from his “most natural” state, the free order- ing, placing, disposing and shaping in the moment of “inspiration” – heknows how strictly and subtly he obeys thousands of laws at this verymoment, laws that defy conceptual formulation precisely because of theirhardness and determinateness (compared with these laws, there is some-thing ﬂoundering, multiple, and ambiguous about even the most solidconcept –). I will say it again: what seems to be essential “in heaven andon earth” is that there be obedience in one direction for a long time. In the long term, this always brings and has brought about something that makes life on earth worth living – for instance: virtue, art, music, dance,reason, intellect – something that transﬁgures, something reﬁned, fantas- tic, and divine. The long un-freedom of spirit, the mistrustful constraintin the communicability of thought, the discipline that thinkers imposedon themselves, thinking within certain guidelines imposed by the churchor court or Aristotelian presuppositions, the long, spiritual will to in-terpret every event according to a Christian scheme and to rediscoverand justify the Christian God in every chance event, – all this violence,arbitrariness, harshness, terror, and anti-reason has shown itself to bethe means through which strength, reckless curiosity , and subtle agilityhave been bred into the European spirit. Admittedly , this also entailedan irreplaceable loss of force and spirit, which have had to be crushed,stiﬂed, and ruined (since here, just like everywhere else, “nature,” showsitself in its utterly wasteful and indifferent glory , which is outrageous but noble). The fact that, for thousands of years, European thinkers havebeen thinking only in order to prove something (these days it is the otherway around: we are suspicious of any thinker who “has something toprove”) – the fact that the results which were supposed to emerge from their most intense contemplations were in fact already ﬁrmly established(somewhat like earlier Asian astrology or even the present-day innocuousChristian-moral interpretation of the most personal events “to the gloryof god” and “to save the soul”): – this tyranny , this arbitrariness, this stern and grandiose stupidity has trained the spirit. Slavery , in both the crude and reﬁned senses of the term, seems to be the indispensable means ofdisciplining and breeding even the spirit.

It is the same type of cleverly invented,cleverly interpolated period of fasting that you ﬁnd all over the ancient world (although there, as is often the case with southern peoples, it is notexactly associated with work –). There need to be many types of fasts;and wherever powerful drives and habits rule, the law-makers have to besure to put in leap days when these drives are chained up and made torelearn what hunger feels like. Entire generations or epochs, emergingin the grips of some moral fanaticism or another, seem (from a higherviewpoint) to be just such interposed periods of compulsion and fasting,the times when a drive learns to cower and submit, but also to keep itselfclean andsharp . Some philosophical sects can be interpreted in this way as well (like the Stoa in the midst of a Hellenistic culture whose air hadbecome heavy and lascivious with the fragrance of aphrodisiacs). – Thisalso suggests an explanation for the paradox of why it was precisely duringEurope’s Christian period and only under the pressure of Christian valuejudgments that the sex drive sublimated itself into love ( amour-passion ).  There is something in Plato’s moral philosophy that does not really belong to him, but is there in spite of him, as it were: namely , the Socratism that Love as passion. ",546

Socrates of course had initially sided withreason, given the taste of his talent – that of a superior dialectician. And, inpoint of fact, didn’t he spend his whole life laughing at the shortcomingsof his clumsy , noble Athenians, who, like all noble people, were menof instinct and could never really account for why they acted the waythey did? But in the end, silently and secretly , he laughed at himselfas well; with his acute conscience and self-scrutiny , he discovered thesame difﬁculty and shortcoming in himself. “Why free ourselves fromthe instincts?” he asked himself; “W e should give them their fair dues, “Plato at the front, Plato at the back, Chimaera in the middle.” ",645

Basically , he had seen through to the irrationality ofmoral judgments. – Plato, who was more innocent in such matters andlacked Socrates’ plebeian craftiness, wanted to use all his strength (the greatest strength a philosopher had ever had at his disposal!) to prove tohimself that reason and the instincts converge independently on a singlegoal, on the Good, or “God”; and, ever since Plato, all theologians andphilosophers have been on the same track. Which is to say: in mattersof morality , it has been instinct, or (as the Christians say) “faith,” or (as I say) “the herd” that has had the upper hand so far.

But reason is onlya tool and Descartes was superﬁcial.  Anyone who investigates the history of a particular science will ﬁnd in itsdevelopment a clue to understanding the oldest and most secret processesof all “knowledge and cognition”: there as here, rash hypotheses, ﬁctions, the dumb good will to “believe,” and a lack of mistrust and patiencedevelop ﬁrst – our senses learn late and never fully learn to be reﬁned,trusty , careful organs of knowledge.

When we hear another language, we involuntarily tryto form the sounds we hear into words that sound more comfortableand familiar to us: so, for instance, German people at one point heard“arcubalista ” and made it into the word “ Armbrust .” Even our senses greet everything novel with reluctance and hostility; and affects like fear, love,and hate, as well as passive affects of laziness, will be dominant during even the “simplest” processes of sensibility . – Just as little as today’s Both words mean “crossbow .” The German term Armbrust literally means “arm-breast” and so mimics the sound but not the sense of the Latin. ",627

Someone elsewith a more suspicious and demanding thirst for possession will see the“question-mark” here, the fact that this is only the appearance of pos-session; such a person will want to examine more closely in order to beparticularly clear as to whether the woman will give not only herself tohim, but also give up what she has or wants for the sake of him –: onlythis will count as “possession” for him.

So, considering the fact that humanity has been the best and most long-standing breeding ground for the cultivationof obedience so far, it is reasonable to suppose that the average per-son has an innate need to obey as a type of formal conscience that com- mands: “Thou shalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally notdo something,” in short: “Thou shalt.” This need tries to satisfy itself and give its form a content, so, like a crude appetite, it indiscriminatelygrabs hold and accepts whatever gets screamed into its ear by some com-mander or another – a parent, teacher, the law , class prejudice, publicopinion – according to its strength, impatience, and tension. The oddly limited character of human development – its hesitancy and lengthi-ness, its frequent regressions and reversals – is due to the fact that theherd instinct of obedience is inherited the best and at the cost of theart of commanding. If we imagine this instinct ever advancing to its fur-thest excesses, in the end there will be nobody with independence orthe ability to command; or, such people will suffer inwardly from badconsciences and need to fool themselves into thinking that they too areonly obeying before they are able to command. This is in fact the sit-uation in Europe today; I call it the moral hypocrisy of the comman-ders. They do not know how to protect themselves from their bad con-sciences except by acting like executors of older or higher commands(from their ancestors, constitution, justice system, laws, or God him-self) or even by borrowing herd maxims from the herd mentality , suchas the “ﬁrst servants of the people,” or the “instruments of the common-weal.” For his part, the herd man of today’s Europe gives himself theappearance of being the only permissible type of man and gloriﬁes those Moral license. ",573

But in those cases wherepeople think they cannot do without a leader and bellwether, they keeptrying to replace the commander with an agglomeration of clever herdmen: this is the origin of all representative constitutions, for example.What a relief it is for these European herd animals, what a deliverancefrom an increasingly intolerable pressure, when, in spite of everything,someone appears who can issue unconditional commands; the impact ofNapoleon’s appearance is the last major piece of evidence for this: – thehistory of Napoleon’s impact is practically the history of the higher hap-piness attained by this whole century in its most worthwhile people and moments.  In an age of disintegration where the races are mixed together, a person will have the legacy of multiple lineages in his body , which means con-ﬂicting (and often not merely conﬂicting) drives and value standards that ﬁght with each other and rarely leave each other alone. A man like this,of late cultures and refracted lights, will typically be a weaker person: hismost basic desire is for an end to the war that he is. His notion of happi- ness corresponds to that of a medicine and mentality of paciﬁcation (forinstance the Epicurean or Christian); it is a notion of happiness as primar-ily rest, lack of disturbance, repletion, unity at last and the “Sabbath ofSabbaths,” to speak with the holy rhetorician Augustine, who was himselfthis sort of person. – But if conﬂict and war affect such a nature as onemore stimulus and goad to life –, and if genuine proﬁciency and ﬁnesse in waging war with himself (which is to say: the ability to control and outwithimself) are inherited and cultivated along with his most powerful andirreconcilable drives, then what emerge are those amazing, incomprehen-sible, and unthinkable ones, those human riddles destined for victory andfor seduction; Alcibiades and Caesar are the most exquisite expressionsof this type (– and I will gladly set by their side that ﬁrst European af- ter my taste, the Hohenstaufen Frederick II), and among artists perhapsLeonardo da Vinci. They appear in exactly those ages when that weakertype, with his longing for peace, comes to the fore. These types belongtogether and derive from the same set of causes. ",600
Page 124,"Beyond Good and Evil  As long as herd utility is the only utility governing moral value judgments, as long as the preservation of the community is the only thing in view andquestions concerning immorality are limited to those things that seemto threaten the survival of the community; as long as this is the case,there cannot yet be a “morality of neighbor love.” Suppose that even here, consideration, pity , propriety , gentleness, and reciprocity of aid arealready practiced in a small but steady way; suppose that even in this state of society , all the drives that would later come to be called by thehonorable name of “virtues” (and, in the end, basically coincide with the concept of “morality”) – suppose that they are already active: at this pointthey still do not belong to the realm of moral valuations at all – they arestillextra-moral . During the best days of Rome, for instance, an act done out of pity was not called either good or evil, moral or immoral; and if itwere praised on its own, the praise would be perfectly compatible with atype of reluctant disdain as soon as it was held up against any action thatserved to promote the common good, the res publica . Ultimately , the “love of the neighbor” is always somewhat conventional, willfully feignedand beside the point compared to fear of the neighbor . After the structure of society seems on the whole to be established and secured against externaldangers, it is this fear of the neighbor that again creates new perspectives ofmoral valuation. Until now , in the spirit of common utility , certain strongand dangerous drives such as enterprise, daring, vindictiveness, cunning,rapacity , and a domineering spirit must have been not only honored (underdifferent names than these of course), but nurtured and cultivated (since,given the threats to the group, they were constantly needed against thecommon enemies). Now , however, since there are no more escape valvesfor these drives, they are seen as twice as dangerous and, one by one, theyare denounced as immoral and abandoned to slander. Now the oppositedrives and inclinations come into moral favor; step by step, the herdinstinct draws its conclusion. How much or how little danger there is tothe community or to equality in an opinion, in a condition or affect, in awill, in a talent, this is now the moral perspective: and fear is once againthe mother of morality . When the highest and strongest drives erupt inpassion, driving the individual up and out and far above the average, overthe depths of the herd conscience, the self-esteem of the community is Commonwealth. ",593
Page 125,"On the natural history of morals destroyed – its faith in itself, its backbone, as it were, is broken: as a result, these are the very drives that will be denounced and slandered the most.A high, independent spiritedness, a will to stand alone, even an excellentfaculty of reason, will be perceived as a threat. Everything that raisesthe individual over the herd and frightens the neighbor will henceforthbe called evil; the proper, modest, unobtrusive, equalizing attitude and themediocrity of desires acquire moral names and honors. Finally , in very peaceable circumstances there are fewer and fewer opportunitiesand less and less need to nurture an instinct for severity or hardness; andnow every severity starts disturbing the conscience, even where justice isconcerned. A high and hard nobility and self-reliance is almost offensive, and provokes suspicion; “the lamb,” and “the sheep” even more, gainsrespect. – There is a point in the history of a society when it becomes pathologically enervated and tenderized and it takes sides, quite honestlyand earnestly , with those who do it harm, with criminals . Punishment: that seems somehow unjust to this society , – it certainly ﬁnds the thoughts of“punishment” and “needing to punish” both painful and frightening.“Isn’t it enough to render him unthreatening ? Why punish him as well? Punishment is itself fearful!” – with these questions, the herd morality ,the morality of timidity , draws its ﬁnal consequences. If the threat, thereason for the fear, could be totally abolished, this morality would beabolished as well: it would not be necessary any more, it would not consider itself necessary any more! Anyone who probes the conscience of today’s European will have to extract the very same imperative from a thousandmoral folds and hiding places, the imperative of herd timidity: “we wantthe day to come when there is nothing more to fear !” The day to come – the will and way to that day is now called “progress” everywhere in Europe.  Let us immediately repeat what we have already said a hundred times before, since there are no ready ears for such truths – for our truths – these days. W e know all too well how offensive it sounds when someoneclassiﬁes human beings as animals, without disguises or allegory; and weare considered almost sinful for constantly using expressions like “herd,” and “herd instinct” with direct reference to people of “modern ideas.” So what? W e cannot help ourselves, since this is where our new insightshappen to lie. Europe, we have found, has become unanimous in all major ",608
Page 126,"Beyond Good and Evil moral judgments; and this includes the countries under Europe’s inﬂu- ence. People in Europe clearly know what Socrates claimed not to know , and what that famous old snake once promised to teach, – people thesedays “know” what is good and evil. Now it must sound harsh and strikethe ear quite badly when we keep insisting on the following point: whatit is that claims to know here, what gloriﬁes itself with its praise andreproach and calls itself good is the instinct of the herd animal man,which has come to the fore, gaining and continuing to gain predominanceand supremacy over the other instincts, in accordance with the growingphysiological approach and approximation whose symptom it is. Moral- ity in Europe these days is the morality of herd animals : – and therefore, as we understand things, it is only one type of human morality besidewhich, before which, and after which many other (and especially higher ) moralities are or should be possible. But this morality ﬁghts tooth andnail against such a “possibility” and such a “should”: it stubbornly and ruthlessly declares “I am morality itself and nothing else is moral!” And infact, with the aid of a religion that indulged and ﬂattered the loftiest herddesires, things have reached the point where this morality is increasinglyapparent in even political and social institutions: the democratic move- ment is the heir to Christianity . But there are indications that the tempoof this morality is still much too slow and lethargic for those who have lesspatience, those who are sick or addicted to the above-mentioned instinct.This is attested to by the increasingly frantic howling, the increasinglyundisguised snarling of the anarchist dogs that now wander the alleywaysof European culture, in apparent opposition to the peaceable and indus-trious democrats and ideologists of revolution, and still more to the sillyphilosophasters and brotherhood enthusiasts who call themselves social-ists and want a “free society .” But, in fact, they are one and all united in thorough and instinctive hostility towards all forms of society besidesthat of the autonomous herd (even to the point of rejecting the concepts of “master” and “slave” – ni dieu ni maˆ ıtre reads a socialist formula –); they are united in their dogged opposition to any special claims, special rights,or privileges (which means, in the last analysis, that they are opposedtoany rights: since when everyone is equal, no one will need “rights” anymore –); they are united in their mistrust of punitive justice (as if itwere a violation of those who are weaker, a wrong against the necessary Neither God nor master. ",625
Page 127,"On the natural history of morals result of all earlier societies –); but they are likewise united in the religion of pity , in sympathy for whatever feels, lives, suffers (down to the animaland up to “God”: – the excessive notion of “pity for God” belongs in a democratic age –); they are all united in the cries and the impatience ofpity , in deadly hatred against suffering in general, in the almost feminineinability to sit watching, to letsuffering happen; they are united in the way they involuntarily raise the general level of sensitivity and gloom un-der whose spell Europe seems threatened with a new Buddhism; they areunited in their faith in the morality of communal pity , as if it were morality in itself, the height, the achieved height of humanity , the sole hope for the future, the solace of the present, the great redemptio n of all guilt from the past: – they are all united in their faith in the community as Redeemer , which is to say: in the herd, in “themselves” ...  W e who have a different faith –, we who consider the democratic move- ment to be not merely an abased form of political organization, but ratheran abased (more speciﬁcally a diminished) form of humanity , a medioc-ritization and depreciation of humanity in value: where do weneed to reach with our hopes? – Towards new philosophers , there is no alterna- tive; towards spirits who are strong and original enough to give impetusto opposed valuations and initiate a revaluation and reversal of “eternalvalues”; towards those sent out ahead; towards the men of the future whoin the present tie the knots and gather the force that compels the will ofmillennia into new channels.

The image of suchleaders hovers before our eyes: – may I say this out loud, you free spirits?

There are few pains as intense as ever having seen, guessed, or sympathized while an extraordinary person ranoff course and degenerated: but someone with an uncommon eye for theoverall danger that “humanity” itself will degenerate , someone like us, who has recognized the outrageous contingency that has been playing gameswith the future of humanity so far – games in which no hand and not even a “ﬁnger of God” has taken part! – someone who has sensed the disas- ter that lies hidden in the idiotic guilelessness and credulity of “modern ideas,” and still more in the whole of Christian-European morality: some-one like this will suffer from an unparalleled sense of alarm.

Page 129,"Part  W e scholars  At the risk that moralizing will prove once again to be what it always was (namely , an undismayed montrer ses plaies ,in the words of Balzac), I will dare to speak out against an inappropriate and harmful shift in the rankorder between science and philosophy; this shift has gone completely un-noticed and now threatens to settle in with what looks like the clearest ofconsciences. I mean: people need to speak from experience (and experience always seems to mean bad experience, doesn’t it?) when it comes to suchlofty questions of rank, or else they are like blind people talking aboutcolors or like women and artists speaking out against science (“Oh, this awful science,” their instincts and shame will sigh, “it always gets to thebottom of things!” –). The scientiﬁc man’s declaration of independence, his emancipation from philosophy , is one of the more subtle effects of thedemocratic way of life (and death): this self-gloriﬁcation and presumptu-ousness of the scholar is in the full bloom of spring, ﬂowering everywhereyou look, – which isn’t to say that this self-importance has a pleasant smell.“ Away with all masters!” – that’s what the rabble instinct wants, even here.And now that science has been so utterly successful in fending off theol-ogy , after having been its “handmaiden” for far too long, it is so high inspirits and low on sense that it wants to lay down laws for philosophy and,for once, play at being “master” – what am I saying! play at being philoso- pher . My memory (the memory of a scientiﬁc man, if you will!) is teeming with the arrogantly naive comments about philosophy and philosophersthat I have heard from young natural scientists and old physicians (not to “Showing one’s wounds.” ",464
Page 130,"Beyond Good and Evil mention from the most erudite and conceited scholars of all, the philol- ogists and schoolmen, who are both by profession –). Sometimes it wasthe specialists and the pigeon-hole dwellers who instinctively resistedall synthetic tasks and skills; at other times it was the diligent workerswho smelled the otium and the noble opulence of the philosopher’s psy- chic economy and consequently felt themselves restricted and belittled.Sometimes it was that color-blindness of utilitarian-minded people whoconsidered philosophy to be just a series of refuted systems and a waste- ful expenditure that never did anybody “any good.” Sometimes a fear ofdisguised mysticism and changes to the limits of knowledge sprang up; atother times, there was disdain for particular philosophers that had unwit-tingly become a disdain for philosophy in general. In the end, I have foundthat what usually lies behind young scholars’ arrogant devalorizations ofphilosophy is the nasty after-effect of some philosopher himself. Thesescholars had, for the most part, stopped listening to this philosopher, butwithout having emerged from under the spell of his dismissive valuationsof other philosophers: – and this resulted in a generalized ill will againstall philosophy . (The after-affects of Schopenhauer on Germany in themost recent past seem to me an example of this sort of thing: – with hisunintelligent ranting against Hegel, he has caused the whole of the lastgeneration of Germans to break off its ties to German culture, a culturethat, all things considered, represented a supreme and divinatory reﬁne-ment of the historical sense . But Schopenhauer was himself impoverished, insensitive, un-German to the point of genius on precisely this point.)Looking at the overall picture, the damage done to the respectability ofphilosophy might be primarily due to the human, all-too-human, and,in short, miserable condition of more recent philosophy itself, which has held open the door to the rabble instinct. W e have to admit the degreeto which our modern world has departed from the whole Heraclitean,Platonic, Empedoclean type (or whatever names all these princely andmagniﬁcent hermits of the spirit might have had); and with what justicea worthy man of science can feel that he is of a better type and a bet- ter lineage, given the sort of representatives of philosophy who, thanksto current fashions, are just as much talked up these days as they arewashed up (in Germany , for instance, the two lions of Berlin: the anar-chist Eugen D ¨uhring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann). And Leisure. ",600
Page 131,"We scholars especially those hodgepodge philosophers who call themselves “philoso- phers of reality” or “positivists” – just the sight of them is enough to instill a dangerous mistrust in the soul of an ambitious young scholar.They are, at best, scholars and specialists themselves – you can just feelit! They have all been defeated but then brought back under the domi- nation of science; they had wanted something more of themselves at one time (without any right to this “more” and its responsibility) – and now ,in word and in deed, they respectably , wrathfully , vengefully represent askepticism concerning philosophy’s master task and authority . In the end: how could it be any other way! Science is thriving these days, its goodconscience shines in its face; meanwhile whatever state recent philosophyhas gradually sunk to, whatever is left of philosophy today , inspires mis-trust and displeasure, if not ridicule and pity . A philosophy reduced to“epistemology ,” which is really no more than a timid epochism and doc-trine of abstinence; a philosophy that does not even get over the thresholdand scrupulously denies itself the right of entry – that is a philosophy in its last gasps, an end, an agony , something to be pitied. How could such aphilosophy – dominate ?  There are so many different kinds of dangers involved in the development of a philosopher these days that it can be doubted whether this fruit is stillcapable of ripening at all. The height and width of the tower of science havegrown to be so monstrously vast that the philosopher is that much morelikely to become exhausted before he has even ﬁnished his education, orto let himself grab hold of something and “specialize.” And so he is never at his best, never reaches a high point in his development from which hewould be able to look over, look around, and look down . Or he gets there too late, when he is already past his prime and his strength has startedto fade; or he gets there disabled, having become coarse and degenerate,so that his gaze, his overall value judgment is largely meaningless. Per-haps the very reﬁnement of his intellectual conscience lets him hesitateand be slowed down while underway; he is afraid of being seduced intobecoming a dilettante, a millipede with a thousand feet and a thousandfeelers; he knows too well that someone who has lost his self-respect willno longer command or lead , even in the ﬁeld of knowledge: unless he wants to become a great actor, a philosophical Cagliostro and rabble-rouser of ",590
Page 132,"Beyond Good and Evil spirits, in short, a seducer. In the end, this is a question of taste, even if it is not a question of conscience. And just to double the philosopher’sdifﬁculties again, there is the additional fact that he demands a judgmentof himself, a Y es or a No, not about science but about life and the valueof life. It is only with reluctance that he comes to believe he has a rightor even a duty to render this sort of a judgment, and he has to draw onthe most wide-ranging (and perhaps the most disturbing and destructive)experiences so that he can look – hesitantly , skeptically , silently – for apath to this right and this belief. In fact, the masses have misjudged andmistaken the philosopher for a long time, sometimes confusing him withthe scientiﬁc man and ideal scholar, and sometimes with the religiously elevated, desensualized, desecularized enthusiasts and intoxicated men of God. If you hear anyone praised these days for living “wisely” or “like a philosopher” it basically just means he is “clever and keeps out of the way .” To the rabble, wisdom seems like a kind of escape, a device or trickfor pulling yourself out of the game when things get rough. But the realphilosopher (and isn’t this how it seems to us, my friends?) lives “un- philosophically ,” “unwisely ,” in a manner which is above all not clever , and feels the weight and duty of a hundred experiments and temptations  of life: – he constantly puts himself at risk, he plays therough game ...  Compared to a genius, which is to say: compared to a being that either begets orgives birth (taking both words in their widest scope –), the scholar, the average man of science, is somewhat like an old maid. Like her, he hasno expertise in the two most valuable acts performed by humanity . And,as a sort of compensation, both the scholar and the old maid are admittedto be respectable – respectability is always emphasized – although in both cases we are annoyed by the obligatory nature of this admission. Letus look more closely: what is the scientiﬁc man? In the ﬁrst place, heis an ignoble type of person with the virtues that an ignoble type willhave: this type is not dominant, authoritative, or self-sufﬁcient. He isindustrious, he is patiently lined up in an orderly array , he is regularand moderate in his abilities and needs, he has an instinct for his ownkind and for the needs of his kind. These needs include: that piece of In German: Versuchen und Versuchungen (see note ,p .above). ",640

He is full of petty jealousies and has eyes like a hawk for thebase aspects of natures whose heights he cannot attain. He is friendly , butonly like someone who lets himself go without letting himself really ﬂow out; and just when he is standing in front of people who really do ﬂow out, he will act all the more cold and reserved, – at times like this, his eye is like a smooth and unwilling lake that will no longer allow a singleripple of joy or sympathy . The worst and most dangerous thing that ascholar is capable of doing comes from his type’s instinct for mediocrity:from that Jesuitism of mediocrity that instinctively works towards theannihilation of the exceptional man and tries to break every taut bowor – even better! – to unbend it. Unbending it with consideration, and, of course, a gentle hand –, unbending it with friendly pity: that is the true art of Jesuitism, which has always known how to introduce itself as a religionof pity . –  However gratefully we might approach the objective spirit – and who hasn’t been sick to death at least once of everything subjective, with its damnedipsissimosity ! – nevertheless, in the end we even have to be cautious of our gratitude, and put an end to the exaggerated terms in which people haverecently been celebrating the desubjectivization and depersoniﬁcation ofspirit, as if this were some sort of goal in itself, some sort of redemption ortransﬁguration. This kind of thing tends to happen within the pessimistschool, which has reasons of its own for regarding “disinterested know-ing” with the greatest respect. The objective man who no longer swearsor complains like the pessimist does, the ideal scholar who expresses the scientiﬁc instinct as it ﬁnally blossoms and blooms all the way (after thingshave gone partly or wholly wrong a thousand times over) – he is certainly Nietzsche’s coinage from the Latin “ ipsissima ” meaning “very own.” ",587

He has so thoroughly becomea passageway and reﬂection of strange shapes and events, that whateveris left in him of a “person” strikes him as accidental, often arbitrary , andstill more often as disruptive. It takes an effort for him to think back on“himself,” and he is not infrequently mistaken when he does. He easily confuses himself with others, he is wrong about his own basic needs, and this is the only respect in which he is crude and careless. Maybe his healthis making him suffer, or the pettiness and provincial airs of a wife or afriend, or the lack of companions and company , – all right then, he makeshimself think about his sufferings: but to no avail!

It is as if they could hear, in his rejection of skepticism,some sort of evil and ominous sound in the distance, as if a new explosivewere being tested somewhere, a dynamite of the spirit, perhaps a newlydiscovered Russian nihiline , a pessimism bonae voluntatisthat does not justsay No or will No, but – the very thought is terrible! – does N o .I ti s generally acknowledged nowadays that no tranquilizer or sedative works “I despise almost nothing.” In lines that follow , presque means “almost” and presque rien means “almost nothing.” A neologism coined from “nihilism.” Of goodwill. ",620

Be quiet already , you pessimistic moles!” Which is to say: theskeptic, that gentle creature, is all too easily frightened. His consciencehas been trained to jump at every no, or even at a decisive and hardenedyes, and to feel it like a bite. Y es! and No! – this is contrary to morality , as far as he is concerned. Conversely , he loves to treat his virtues to a feast ofnoble abstinence, when, for instance, he says, with Montaigne: “What do I know?” Or with Socrates: “I know that I don’t know anything.” Or “I don’ttrust myself here, there aren’t any doors open to me.” Or: “Even if onewere open, why go in right away!” Or: “What good are rash hypotheses?It might very well be good taste not to formulate any hypotheses at all.When something is crooked, do you people really need to straighten itright away? or plug something into every hole? Isn’t there plenty of timefor that? Doesn’t time have plenty of time? Oh, you ﬁends, why can’t you justwait a while? Even uncertainty has its charms, even the Sphinx is a Circe, even Circe was a philosopher.” – This is how a skeptic comfortshimself; and it is true that he needs some comfort. Skepticism is the mostspiritual expression of a certain complex physiological condition which inlayman’s terms is called weak nerves or a sickly constitution. It originateswhenever races or classes that have been separated for a long time aresuddenly and decisively interbred. The different standards and values,as it were, get passed down through the bloodline to the next generationwhere everything is in a state of restlessness, disorder, doubt, experimen-tation. The best forces have inhibitory effects, the virtues themselves donot let each other strengthen and grow , both body and soul lack a cen-ter of balance, a center of gravity and the assurance of a pendulum. Butwhat is most profoundly sick and degenerate about such hybrids is thewill : they no longer have any sense of independence in decision-making, or the bold feeling of pleasure in willing, – they doubt whether there is“freedom of will,” even in their dreams. Our contemporary Europe, thesite of an absurdly sudden experiment in the radical mixing of classes andconsequently of races, is therefore skeptical from its heights to its depths, sometimes with that agile kind of skepticism that leaps impatiently and ",700

Paralysis of the will: where won’t you ﬁnd this cripple today? And often how nicely dressed! How seductively dressed! This illness has theprettiest fancy-dress clothes and liar’s outﬁts. And most of what presentsitself in the shop windows these days as “objectivity ,” for instance, or “scientiﬁcity ,” “ l’art pour l’art ,” or “pure, will-less knowing,” is only dressed-up skepticism and paralysis of the will, – I will vouch for thisdiagnosis of the European disease. – The disease of the will has spreadunevenly across Europe. It appears greatest and most varied where theculture has been at home for the longest period of time; and it becomesincreasingly faint to the extent that “the barbarian” still – or once again – asserts his rights under the sagging robes of occidental cultivation. This is why the will is most sick in present-day France, a fact which can be logically concluded as easily as it can be palpably felt. France has alwayshad the brilliant historical sense to turn even disastrous changes of itsspirit into something charming and seductive. Now , it clearly indicatesits culturally dominant position within Europe by being the school andshowcase for all the magic spells of skepticism. The strength to will and,in fact, a will to will at length, is somewhat more vigorous in Germany ,and stronger in the north of Germany than in the center. It is consider-ably stronger in England, Spain, and Corsica; in one place it is bound upwith apathy , in another, with hard heads, – not to mention Italy , which is too young to know what it wants, and which ﬁrst needs to prove thatitcan will –. But it is the strongest of all and the most amazing in that vast intermediary zone where Europe, as it were, ﬂows back into Asia: inRussia. There, the strength to will has been laid aside and stored up overa long time; there, the will is waiting threateningly (uncertain whether asa will of negation or of afﬁrmation), to be discharged (to borrow a favoriteterm from today’s physicists). More than just Indian wars and Asian in-trigues might be needed to relieve Europe of its greatest danger – inner rebellions might be needed as well, the dispersion of the empire into smallbodies, and, above all, the introduction of parliamentary nonsense, addedto which would be the requirement that every man read his newspaperover breakfast. This is not something I am hoping for. I would preferthe opposite, – I mean the sort of increase in the threat Russia poses that “ Art for art’s sake.” ",655

That completely unscrupulous devoteeof tall, handsome grenadiers who, as king of Prussia, brought a militaryand skeptical genius into being (and with it, fundamentally , that new typeof German which is only now approaching in triumph), the questionable,mad father of Frederick the Great, had the grasp and lucky claw of a genius too, although on one point only: he knew what was missing inGermany in those days, and which lack was a hundred times more urgentand anxiety-provoking than the lack of something like education or socialdecorum, – his dislike for young Frederick came from the anguish of a profound instinct. Men were lacking ; and he suspected, to his most bit- ter distress, that his own son was not man enough. He was wrong aboutthis, but who wouldn’t have been wrong in his place? He saw his sonfalling prey to atheism, esprit , and the entertaining, happy-go-lucky spirit of clever Frenchmen: he saw that enormous bloodsucker, the spider ofskepticism, in the background, and he suspected the incurable misery of aheart that was no longer hard enough for evil or for good, of a shattered willthat no longer commanded, that was no longer able to command. Mean- while, however, a harsher and more dangerous new type of skepticism wasgrowing in his son (and who knows how much it was encouraged preciselybyhis father’s hatred and the icy melancholy of an isolated will?) – the Frederick William I. ",546

This skepticism despises and nevertheless appropri-ates; it undermines and takes possession; it does not believe but does notdie out on this account; it gives the spirit a dangerous freedom, but issevere on the heart. The German form of skepticism (being a continued Frederickianism that has been intensiﬁed to the most spiritual degree)has put Europe under the dominion of German spirit with its critical andhistorical mistrust for a long time. Thanks to the unyielding strengthand tenacity in the masculine character of the great German philologistsand critical historians (seen properly , they were also all artists of decay and destruction), and in spite of all the romanticism in music and philosophy , anew concept of the German spirit is gradually emerging, and it clearly tends towards a masculine skepticism: it might be the intrepidity of thegaze, the courage and severity of the dissecting hand, or the tenacious willto dangerous voyages of discovery , to spiritualized North Pole expeditionsunder desolate and dangerous skies. Warm-blooded and superﬁcial hu-manitarians may have good reasons for crossing themselves in front ofthis spirit; cet esprit fataliste, ironique, m´ ephistoph´ elique as Michelet calls it, not without a shudder. But this “man” in the German spirit, whichhas awoken Europe from its “dogmatic slumber,” – if you want to un- derstand how distinctive the fear of this “man” really is, just rememberthe earlier conception that this one had to overcome, – and how it wasnot so long ago that a masculinized woman could dare, with boundless presumption, to commend the Germans to European sympathies as gen- tle, good-hearted, weak-willed, poetic fools. Y ou can really understandNapoleon’s surprise when he got to see Goethe: it showed what people had understood by the term “German spirit” for centuries. “ Voil`au n homme! ” – which was to say: “Now there’s a man ! And I’d only expected a German!” – “This fatalistic, ironical, Mephistophelian spirit.” An allusion to Kant’s claim in the Prolegomena zu einer jeden k¨ unftigen Metaphysik (Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics )( ) that Hume’s empiricism awoke him from the dogmatic slumber of rationalism. Madame de Sta ¨el in her De l’Allemagne (On Germany )( ). See Goethe’s Unterredung mit Napoleon (Discussion with Napoleon )(October  ). ",718
Page 140,"Beyond Good and Evil  So, if something in the image of future philosophers makes us suspect that they will, perhaps, be skeptics (in the sense just mentioned), then it wouldonly indicate some aspect of them and notwho they themselves really are. They could be called critics with equal justiﬁcation; and they will certainlybe engaged in experiments. I have already laid particular emphasis on the notions of tempting, attempting, and the joy of experimenting in the namethat I have dared to christen them with: is this because, as critics in body and soul, they love to experiment in a new , perhaps broader, perhaps moredangerous sense? In their passion for knowledge, won’t they need to gofurther, with bold and painful experiments, than the faint-hearted, pam-pered taste of a democratic century can think proper? – Without a doubt:these coming philosophers will be least able to dispense with the qualitiesthat distinguish the critic from the skeptic – qualities that are rather seri-ous and by no means harmless. I mean: the certainty of value standards, theconscious implementation of a unity of method, a sly courage, a solitarystance, and capacity for responsibility . In fact, these philosophers admitto taking pleasure in saying no, in dissecting, and in a certain level-headed cruelty that knows how to guide a knife with assurance and subtlety , evenwhen the heart is bleeding. They will be more severe (and perhaps not always with themselves alone) than humane people might wish them tobe. They will not engage with “truth” in such a way that it “pleases” or“elevates” or “inspires” them; they will hardly believe that the truth ,o f all things, would keep the feelings this amused. These severe spirits willsmile when they hear someone say: “This thought elevates me: how couldit fail to be true?” Or: “This work charms me: how could it fail to be beau- tiful?” Or: “That artist ennobles me: how could he fail to be noble?” – they might be ready not just with a smile but with a genuine disgust for all theseover-enthusiasms, idealisms, femininities, hermaphrodisms. And anyonewho knows how to follow these spirits down into the secret chambers oftheir heart is not likely to discover any intention to reconcile “Christianfeelings” with “ancient taste” or with anything like “modern parliamen- tarianism” (although these sorts of conciliatory overtures are said to takeplace in our very uncertain and consequently very conciliatory century ,even among philosophers). These philosophers of the future will demand(and not only of themselves) critical discipline and every habit that leads tocleanliness and rigor in matters of the spirit. They might even wear these ",640
Page 141,"We scholars like a type of jewel they have on display , – nevertheless, they still do not want to be called critics. They think it is no small disgrace for philosophythese days, when people are so happy to announce: “Philosophy itself iscriticism and critical science – and nothing else whatsoever!” H owever much all the French and German positivists might approve of this eval-uation of philosophy (– and it might even have ﬂattered Kant’s heart and taste: just think of the titles of his major works –), our new philosopherswill nevertheless say: critics are tools of philosophy and that is preciselywhy , being tools, they are so far from being philosophers! Even the greatChinaman of K ¨onigsberg was only a great critic. –  I am going to insist that people ﬁnally stop mistaking philosophical la- borers and scientiﬁc men in general for philosophers, – that here, of all places, people be strict about giving “each his due” and not too much tothe one, and much too little to the other. In the course of his education,the genuine philosopher might have been required to stand on each of thesteps where his servants, the philosophical scientiﬁc laborers, have cometo a stop, – have had to come to a stop. Perhaps the philosopher has had to be a critic and a skeptic and a dogmatist and historian and, moreover,a poet and collector and traveler and guesser of riddles and moralist andseer and “free spirit” and practically everything, in order to run through the range of human values and value feelings and be able to gaze with many eyes and consciences from the heights into every distance, from thedepths up to every height, from the corner onto every expanse. But allthese are only preconditions for his task: the task itself has another will, –it calls for him to create values . The project for philosophical laborers on the noble model of Kant and Hegel is to establish some large class of givenvalues (which is to say: values that were once posited and created but have come to dominate and have been called “truths” for a long time) and press it into formulas, whether in the realm of logic orpolitics (morality) or art. It is up to these researchers to make everything that has happened or beenvalued so far look clear, obvious, comprehensible, and manageable, to ab-breviate everything long, even “time” itself, and to overwhelm the entire past. This is an enormous and wonderful task, in whose service any subtle An allusion to Kant, who spent his life in K ¨onigsberg. ",609
Page 142,"Beyond Good and Evil pride or tough will can certainly ﬁnd satisfaction. But true philosophers are commanders and legislators : they say “That is how it should be!” they are the ones who ﬁrst determine the “where to?” and “what for?” of people, which puts at their disposal the preliminary labor of all philosophical la-borers, all those who overwhelm the past. True philosophers reach forthe future with a creative hand and everything that is and was becomesa means, a tool, a hammer for them.

Have there ever been philosophers like this?W on’t there h a v et ob e philosophers like this? ...  It seems increasingly clear to me that the philosopher, being necessarily a person of tomorrow and the day after tomorrow , has, in every age, beenand has needed to be at odds with his today: his enemy has always been the ideal of today . So far, all these extraordinary patrons of humanity whoare called philosophers (and who have seldom felt like friends of wisdom,but like disagreeable fools and dangerous question-marks instead –) havefound that their task, their harsh, unwanted, undeniable task (though inthe end, the greatness of their task) lay in being the bad conscience of their age. In applying a vivisecting knife directly to the chest of the virtues of the age, they gave away their own secret: to know a new greatness in humanity , a new , untraveled path to human greatness. Every time they have donethis, they have shown how much hypocrisy and laziness, how much lettingyourself go and letting go of yourself, how many lies are hidden beneaththe most highly honored type of their present-day morality , and how much virtue is out of date . Every time, they have said: “W e need to go there, out there, out where you feel least at home today .” When encountering a world of “modern ideas” which would gladly banish everyone into a corner and “specialization,” a philosopher (if there could be philosophers today)would be compelled to locate the greatness of humanity , the conceptof “greatness,” in the very scope and variety of humanity , in its unityin multiplicity . He would determine even value and rank according tohow much and how many things someone could carry and take uponhimself, how farsomeone could stretch his responsibility .

Page 143,"We scholars the hardness and capacity for long-term resolutions must belong to the concept of “greatness,” in the philosopher’s ideal. With equal justice,the opposite doctrine and the ideal of a stupid, self-abnegating, humble,selﬂess humanity was suited to an opposite age, to an age like the sixteenthcentury that suffered from its accumulated energy of the will and fromthe most savage ﬂoods and storm tides of egoism. In the age of Socrates,among honest people with tired instincts, among conservatives of ancientAthens who let themselves go – “toward happiness,” as they put it, toward pleasure, as they did it – and who kept mouthing old, magniﬁcent words(words that they had absolutely no right to use any more, given the livesthey were leading), – here, perhaps, irony was needed for greatness of soul, that malicious, Socratic certainty of the old physician and man of the rabble who cut brutally into his own ﬂesh like he cut into the ﬂesh and heart of the “noble,” with a glance that spoke clearly enough: “Don’t actsome part in front of me! Here – we are equals!” These days, by contrast,when only the herd animal gets and gives honor in Europe, when “equalrights” could all too easily end up as equal wrongs (I mean, in waging ajoint war on everything rare, strange, privileged, on the higher man, highersoul, higher duty , higher responsibility , on creative power and mastery) –these days, the concept of “greatness” will include: being noble, wantingto be for yourself, the ability to be different, standing alone and needing tolive by your own ﬁsts. And the philosopher will be revealing something ofhis own ideal when he proposes: “Greatest of all is the one who can be themost solitary , the most hidden, the most different, the person beyond goodand evil, the master of his virtues, the one with an abundance of will. Onlythis should be called greatness : the ability to be just as multiple as whole, just as wide as full.” And to ask once again: is greatness possible today?  It is difﬁcult to learn what a philosopher is, because it cannot be taught: you have to “know” by experience, – or you should be proud that you donot know it at all. But nowadays everyone talks about things that they cannot experience, and most especially (and most terribly) when it comes to philosophers and philosophical matters. Hardly anyone knows aboutthem or is allowed to know , and all popular opinions about them are false.So, for instance, the genuinely philosophical compatibility between a boldand lively spirituality that runs along at a presto , and a dialectical rigor and ",633

Artists might have a better sense of smell even in this matter: they are the ones who know only too well that their feeling offreedom, ﬁnesse and authority , of creation, formation, and control only reaches its apex when they have stopped doing anything “voluntarily” and instead do everything necessarily , – in short, they know that insidethemselves necessity and “freedom of the will” have become one. In the last analysis, there is a rank order of psychic states which corresponds tothe rank order of problems; and the highest problems will ruthlessly repelanyone who dares to get close without being predestined by sheer statureand power of spirituality to reach a solution.

Ultimately , they all wantEnglish morality to be given its dues: since it is best for humanity , for the “general utility” or “the happiness of the majority” – no! the happinessofEngland . They want, with all the strength they can muster, to prove to themselves that striving for English happiness, I mean for comfort andfashion (and, at the highest level, for a seat in Parliament), is the proper path to virtue as well, and, in fact, that whatever virtue has existed inthe world so far has involved just this sort of striving.

This is my claim: almost everything we call“higher culture” is based on the spiritualization and deepening of cruelty .

And what pleases us in so-called tragic pity as well as ineverything sublime, up to the highest and most delicate of metaphysicaltremblings, derives its sweetness exclusively from the intervening com-ponent of cruelty .

Its needs and abilities are the same ones that physi-ologists have established for everything that lives, grows, and propagates.The power of spirit to appropriate foreign elements manifests itself in astrong tendency to assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the manifold,to disregard or push aside utter inconsistencies: just as it will arbitrarilyselect certain aspects or outlines of the foreign, of any piece of the “externalworld,” for stronger emphasis, stress, or falsiﬁcation in its own interest.

While women are seizing newrights in this manner, trying to become “master” and writing “progress”for women on their ﬂags and pennants, the opposite is taking place withterrifying clarity: woman are regressing . Ever since the French Revolution, the inﬂuence of women in Europe has decreased proportionately as they have gained rights and entitlements. Accordingly , the “emancipation ofwomen,” to the extent that it has been demanded and called for by womenthemselves (and not just by shallow-minded masculine dolts), turns outto be a strange symptom of the increased weakening and softening of themost feminine instincts of all. The stupidity in this movement, an almost masculine stupidity , is enough to make any woman who has turned outwell (which always means a clever woman) thoroughly ashamed. To loseyour sense for which ground best insures your victory; to neglect prac-tice of your own military arts; to lose control of yourself in front of men,perhaps even “to the point of writing books,” where you used to act with discipline and subtle, cunning humility; to work with virtuous courageagainst men’s belief in any veiled , fundamentally different ideal in women, ",581

Of course, there are plenty of idiotic friendsand corrupters of women among the scholarly asses of the male sex whorecommend that women defeminize themselves like this and copy all thestupidities that the “man” in Europe, that European “manliness” suffersfrom, – who would like to bring women down to the level of “generaleducation,” and maybe even of reading the newspapers and taking partin politics. Every now and then, people even want to make free spiritsand literati out of women: as if a woman without piety were anything other than absolutely repugnant or ludicrous to a profound and godlessman –.

Suppose that a statesman putshis people in the position of needing to do ‘great politics’ in the future,although they are ill equipped and ill prepared by nature for this task, sothat they need to sacriﬁce their old and reliable virtues for the sake of anew and dubious mediocrity , – suppose that such a statesman condemnshis people to any ‘political activity’ at all, when in fact they have had better things to do and to think about until now , and at the bottom of their souls ",636

The same new conditions that generally lead to a leveling andmediocritization of man – a useful, industrious, abundantly serviceable, and able herd animal man – are to the highest degree suitable for givingrise to exceptional people who possess the most dangerous and attractivequalities. Considering the fact that every adaptive force which system-atically tests an ever-changing set of conditions (starting over with eachgeneration, practically with each decade) does not make the powerfulness of the type even remotely possible; considering the fact that the over- all impression of such future Europeans will probably be of exceedingly garrulous, impotent and eminently employable workers who need masters and commanders like they need their daily bread; and, ﬁnally , consideringthe fact that Europe’s democratization amounts to the creation of a typeprepared for slavery in the most subtle sense: taking all this into account, thestrong person will need, in particular and exceptional cases, to get stronger and richer than he has perhaps ever been so far, – thanks to a lackof prejudice in his schooling, thanks to an enormous diversity in practice,art, and masks.

Now that the most successful type of newGermanism desires a completely different sort of honor and has, perhaps,come to regret the absence of a certain “elan” in everything profound, itis almost timely and patriotic to ask whether people have not been fool-ing themselves with this praise; in short, whether German profundityis not something fundamentally different and worse – and something we ",516
Page 171,"Peoples and fatherlands are about to get rid of, thank God. So: to try to change our ideas about German profundity , all we need is a little vivisection of the German soul. –More than anything else, the German soul is multiple, it originates in dif-ferent places and is more piled up and pieced together than actually con-structed: this is due to its origin. A German with the audacity to claim “twosouls, alas, are dwelling in my breast” would be abusing the truth quite badly , or to be more accurate, would fall quite a few souls short of the truth.As a people composed of the most enormous assortment and combinationof races (perhaps even with a preponderance of the pre-Aryan element), asa “people of the middle” in every sense, the Germans are more incompre- hensible, comprehensive, contradictory , unfamiliar, unpredictable, sur-prising, and even frightening than other peoples are to themselves: – they escape deﬁnition which by itself makes them the despair of the French. It is characteristic of the Germans that the question “what is German?” neverdies out with them. Kotzebue certainly knew his Germans well enough:“W e are known” they called out to him in joy , – but Sand claimed to know them too. Jean Paul knew what he was doing when he came out furiouslyagainst Fichte’s dishonest but patriotic ﬂattery and exaggerations –b u t Goethe probably felt differently from Jean Paul about the Germans, eventhough he thought Jean Paul was right about Fichte. What didGoethe re- ally think about the Germans? – But Goethe never did speak plainly aboutmany of the things around him, and was an expert at subtle silence all hislife: – he probably had his reasons. It is clear that the “Wars of Liberation”did not raise his level of enthusiasm any more than the French Revolutionhad done; the event that made him rethink his Faust – and indeed the whole problem of “man” – was the appearance of Napoleon. There are sayings where Goethe speaks as if from abroad, disputing with impatienthardness just what Germans take pride in. He once deﬁned the famousGerman Gem¨ ut as “tolerance towards others’ weaknesses as well as your own.” Was he wrong? It is characteristic of the Germans that people arerarely completely wrong about them.

Foreigners stand amazedand enthralled before the riddles posed to them by the contradictory na-ture at the base of the German soul (which Hegel brought into a systemand Richard Wagner ﬁnally set to music). “Good-natured and spiteful” –a juxtaposition like this, which would be absurd in reference to any otherpeople, is all too often justiﬁed in Germany (unfortunately: just live withSwabians for a while!).

How the noblest stands right next to the most base! How disor-derly and rich this whole psychic economy really is! The German lugs his soul around, he lugs around everything he experiences. He digests hisevents badly , he is never “ﬁnished” with them; German profundity is oftenjust a weak and sluggish “digestion.” And just as everyone who is chron- ically ill (all dyspeptics) tends toward comfortable things, the Germanslove “openness” and everything “upright.” How comfortable it is to be open and upright! Today , the Germans are expert at what is perhaps thehappiest and most dangerous disguise, that trusting, accommodating, all-cards-on-the-table attitude of genuine German honesty : this is their truly Mephistophelean art, and with it they can “still go far”! The German lets himself go, looks out with true, blue, empty German eyes, – and for-eigners immediately mistake him for his nightshirt! – What I am tryingto say is: let “German profundity” be what it will (and just between us, perhaps, we will allow ourselves a laugh at its expense?), we would dowell to honor its appearance and good name in the future as well, and Before the eyes. In German: Biederkeit . From Goethe’s Faust part I, line  . ",663

How lucky for usthat his Rococo still speaks to us, that his “good com- pany ,” his tender enthusiasms, his childish pleasure in Chinoiserie and fancy ﬂourishes, his courtesy of the heart, his longing for the delicate andthe amorous, for dancing and tearful moments of bliss, his faith in thesouth, might still appeal to some vestige in us!

Beethoven falls somewhere betweena brittle old soul that is constantly coming apart and an overly young,future-oriented soul that is constantly on its way . A dusk of eternal loss and eternal, wild hope lies over his music – the same light that lay across Europe when it dreamed with Rousseau, danced around the freedom treeof the Revolution and ended up practically worshipping Napoleon. Buthow quickly this very feeling is now fading, how difﬁcult it is to even know about this feeling these days – how foreign the language of this Rousseau,Schiller, Shelley , and Byron sounds to our ear, these men in whom, collec- tively , the same European destiny which in Beethoven knew how to sing, found its way into words! – What became of German music afterwardsbelongs in romanticism, which is to say in a movement that was (calcu-lated historically), even briefer, more ﬂeeting and more superﬁcial than that great entr’acte , that European transition from Rousseau to Napoleon and the rise of democracy .

Things were different with Felix Mendelssohn, that halcyon masterwho, thanks to his easier, purer, happier soul, was quickly honored andjust as quickly forgotten, as a lovely incident in German music. But when it comes to Robert Schumann, who took things seriously and was fromthe start taken seriously himself (he is the last to have founded a school):don’t we think of it today as a stroke of luck, a relief, a liberation thatjust this Schumannian romanticism has been overcome?

Germansdo not read aloud, they do not read for the ear but only with the eye, keep-ing their ears in a drawer in the meantime. When ancient people read, ifthey read at all (it happened seldom enough), it was aloud to themselves,and moreover in a loud voice. People were surprised by someone readingquietly , and secretly wondered why . In a loud voice: that means with allthe swells, inﬂections, sudden changes in tone, and shifts in tempo that theancient, public world took pleasure in. At that time, the rules for written style were the same as those for spoken style, and those rules dependedin part on the astonishing development and subtle requirements of theear and larynx, and also, in part, on the strength, endurance, and powerof the ancient lung. What the ancients meant by a period is primarily aphysiological unit insofar as it is combined in a single breath. Periods likethe ones that occur in Demosthenes and Cicero – swelling up twice and twice sinking down and all within a single breath – those were a delight for people of antiquity who knew from their own training to value the virtue of the rarity and difﬁculty involved in performing periods like these. We have no real right to the great period, we who are modern, we who are short-winded in every sense! On the whole, these ancients were them- selves dilettantes in rhetoric, and therefore authorities, and consequentlycritics – this is how they drove their rhetoricians to extremes. Similarly , ",602

But in Germany there was (until very recently , when a sort ofgrandstand verbosity shyly and awkwardly stirred its young wings) reallyonly one species of public and vaguely artistic rhetoric, and that came from the pulpit. In Germany , only the preachers knew the weight of aword or syllable, the extent to which a sentence stumbled, sprang, rang,ran, or ran away . They were the only ones with a conscience in their ears,which was often enough an evil conscience: because there was no short-age of reasons why a German of all people should achieve competencein rhetoric infrequently and almost always too late. This is why the mas- terpiece of German prose is by all rights the masterpiece of its greatest preacher: the Bible has been the best German book to date. Compared to Luther’s Bible, almost everything else is merely “literature” – somethingthat had not grown in Germany and for that reason did not grow and isnot growing into German hearts like the Bible did.  There are two types of genius: one that fundamentally begets and wantsto beget, and another that is happy to be impregnated and give birth.Similarly with peoples of genius, there are those who inherit the femaleproblem of pregnancy and the secret task of forming, ripening, and bring-ing to completion – the Greeks, for instance, were this type of people aswell as the French –; and others who need to impregnate and be the causeof new orders of life, – like the Jews, the Romans, and, to pose a modest question, the Germans? – peoples tortured and delighted by unknownfevers who irresistibly leave themselves, loving and lusting after foreignraces (after ones who “let themselves be impregnated” –) and also domi- neering, like everything that knows itself to be full of creative forces andconsequently knows of “God’s grace.” These two types of genius look for each other like men and women; but they also misunderstand eachother, – like men and women.  Every people has its own tartufferies, and calls them its virtues.

With today’s Germans, for instance, there is the anti-French stupidityone moment and the anti-Jewish stupidity the next, now the anti-Polishstupidity , now the Christian-Romantic, the Wagnerian, the Teutonic, thePrussian (just look at these poor historians, these Sybels and Treitschkeswith their thickly bandaged heads –), or whatever else they might becalled, these little stupors of the German spirit and conscience. Pleaseforgive the fact that, during a short and risky stay in a badly infectedregion, I did not completely escape this illness either, and like everyoneelse started worrying about things that were none of my business: the ﬁrstsign of political infection. About the Jews, for instance: just listen. – I have yet to meet a German who was well disposed towards Jews. And however unconditional the rejection of genuine anti-Semitism might be on the part of every prudent or political person, such prudence and poli-tics are not really aimed at anti-Semitic sentiment in general, but insteadat its dangerous excess, and especially at the outrageous and disgrace-ful expression of this excessive sentiment – this cannot be denied. ThatGermany has ample quantities of Jews, that the German stomach and the German blood have difﬁculty (and will continue for a long time tohave difﬁculty) coping with even this number of “Jews” – as the Italians,the French, the British have coped, due to a stronger digestion –: thisis the clear statement and language of a universal instinct that needs to ",570
Page 178,"Beyond Good and Evil be listened to and acted on. “Don’t let in any more Jews! And lock the doors to the east in particular (even to Austria)!” – so commands theinstinct of a people whose type is still weak and indeterminate enoughto blur easily and be easily obliterated by a stronger race. But the Jewsare without a doubt the strongest, purest, most tenacious race living inEurope today . They know how to thrive in even the worst conditions (andactually do better than in favorable ones) due to some virtues that peopletoday would like to see labeled as vices, – above all, thanks to a resolutefaith that does not need to feel ashamed in the face of “modern ideas.” The Jews change, ifthey change, only in the way the Russian empire makes its conquests (being an empire that has time and was not made yesterday): namely , according to the fundamental principle “as slowly as possible!” A thinker who has Europe’s future on his conscience will, in every sketch he draws of this future, consider the Jews, like the Russians,to be the most certain and probable factors at present in the great playand struggle of forces. What gets called a “nation” in Europe today (and is really more a res facta than nata – every once in a while a res ﬁcta et pictawill look exactly the same –) is, in any case, something young, easily changed, and in a state of becoming, not yet a race let alone the sort of aere perenniusthat the Jewish type is: these “nations” should be on a careful lookout for any hotheaded rivalry and hostility! The fact that the Jews, ifthey wanted (or if they were forced, as the anti-Semites seem to want),could already be dominant, or indeed could quite literally have control over present-day Europe – this is established. The fact that they are not working and making plans to this end is likewise established. Meanwhile,what they wish and want instead, with a uniﬁed assertiveness even, is tobe absorbed and assimilated into Europe; they thirst for some place wherethey can be settled, permitted, respected at last and where they can putan end to the nomadic life, the “wandering Jew” –; and this urge andimpulse (which in itself perhaps already reveals a slackening of the Jewishinstincts) should be carefully noted and accommodated – in which caseit might be practical and appropriate to throw the anti-Semitic hooligansout of the country .

That fatuous dolt, Carlyle, knew well enough what Englandlacks and has always lacked; Carlyle, that half-actor and rhetorician whotried to conceal under impassioned grimaces what he knew about himself:namely , what he lacked – real power of intellect, real profundity of spiritual vision, in short: philosophy . It is characteristic of an unphilosophicalrace like this to ﬁrmly support Christianity: they need its discipline to be “moralized” and in some sense humanized. It is just because the Englishare gloomier, stronger-willed, more sensuous, and more brutal than theGermans that they , as the baser of the two, are the more pious as well:they need Christianity that much more. To subtler nostrils, even this English Christianity bears the genuinely English odor of the very spleenand alcoholic dissipation against which it is rightly used as a remedy , – the subtler poison treating the cruder.

W e are coming up against thisperhaps unpleasant proposition right now , since the spirit of worthy butmediocre Englishmen – I mean Darwin, John Stuart Mill, and HerbertSpencer – is starting to come to prominence in the middle regions of European taste. In fact, who would doubt the utility of having spiritslike these prevail for the time being? It would be a mistake to think that far-ﬂying spirits of the highest type would be particularly adept at de-tecting, collecting, and drawing conclusions from lots of common littlefacts: – rather, being exceptions, they are not well situated with respectto the “rule.” Ultimately , they have more to do than just to know – theyhave to besomething new , mean something new , and present new values! The chasm between knowing something and being able to do it is per-haps even greater and more uncanny than it is generally thought to be:people who can do things in the grand style, the creators, might need tobe ignorant. On the other hand, when it comes to scientiﬁc discoveries ofa Darwinian type, a certain narrowness, aridity , and diligent, painstakingcare – in short, something English – is not a bad thing to have at your disposal. – Finally , let us not forget that the English have caused a to-tal depression of the European spirit once already with their profound ",591

What people call “modern ideas” or “eighteenth-century ideas” or even “French ideas” – in other words, what the German spirit rebelled against in profound disgust –, was English in origin, there is nodoubt about it. The French were just the apes and actors (as well as the bestsoldiers) of these ideas, and unfortunately their ﬁrst and most thoroughvictims too, since the ˆame fran¸ caise ended up so sparse and emaciated from the damned Anglomania of “modern ideas” that people these dayslook back at its sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, its profound impas-sioned strength, and its inventive nobility , with something bordering ondisbelief. But we have to hold on to this statement of historical fairnesswith our teeth and defend it against the moment and appearances: theEuropean noblesse (of feeling, of taste, of manner – in short, taking the word in all its higher senses) – is France’s work and invention; European baseness, the plebeianism of modern ideas – is England’s .–  France is still the seat of the most spiritual and sophisticated culture in Europe today , and the preeminent school of taste: but you have to knowhow to ﬁnd this “France of taste.” People belonging to it keep themselveswell hidden: – there might be only a small number of people in whichit loves and lives, people who might not have the sturdiest legs to standon, some of them fatalists, somber and ill, some of them pampered andover the top, people who have the ambition to hide themselves. There is something they all have in common: they shut their ears to the raging stu-pidity and the noisy jabbering of the democratic bourgeoisie. In fact, it isa coarsened and stultiﬁed France that thrashes around in the foregroundthese days, – it recently celebrated a real orgy of bad taste combined withself-admiration at Victor Hugo’s funeral. They have something else in common too: the goodwill to ward off spiritual Germanization – and aneven better inability to do it! Perhaps Schopenhauer is more at home andsettled now in this France of the spirit (which is also a France of pes-simism) than he ever was in Germany; not to mention Heinrich Heine,who has been in the ﬂesh and blood of the subtler and more promisinglyric poets of Paris for a while now; or Hegel who, in the form of Taine French soul. In . ",627

But as far as Wagner goes, themore French music learns to develop according to the real needs of the ˆame moderne , the more “Wagnerianized” it becomes; this can be pre- dicted, – it is already happening now! Nevertheless, there are three thingsthat, even today , the French can proudly exhibit as their heir and theirown and an enduring mark of an old cultural superiority over Europe,in spite of any voluntary or involuntary Germaniza tion or vulgarization of taste. One is the capacity for artistic passions and devotion to “form,” for which the phrase l’art pour l’art (along with a thousand others) was invented. Things like this have not been absent from France for the lastthree hundred years and, thanks to a reverence for “small numbers,” keepmaking possible a type of literary chamber music that is not to be foundanywhere else in Europe –. The second point on which France can basea claim to superiority over Europe is its old, diverse culture of moralism , which means that even among little romanciers of newspapers and chance boulevardiers de Parisyou will ﬁnd, on average, a psychological sensitiv- ity and curiosity that people in Germany , for instance, have no conceptof (much less the thing itself !). For this, the Germans would need a fewhundred years of moralism which, as I have said, France had not spareditself. Anyone calling the Germans “naive” on this account is dressing upa deﬁciency as a compliment. (As a contrast to the German inexperienceand innocence in voluptate psychologica – which is not at all unrelated to the tedium of German company –, and as the most successful expressionof a genuinely French curiosity and inventiveness in this realm of delicatetremblings, we can name Henri Beyle.

Using a temperament that is turned periodically towards andaway from the south, and whose Provenc ¸al and Ligurian blood bubbles over from time to time, the French fortify themselves against the awfulnorthern gray on gray , the sunless concept-ghostliness and anemia, – ourGerman disease of the taste, against whose excess people at the moment are strongly resolved to prescribe blood and iron: I mean “great politics” (following a dangerous medical practice that teaches me to wait and waitbut not, so far, to hope –). And in France there is still a predispositionto understand and accommodate those rarer and rarely satisﬁed peoplewho are too far-ranging to ﬁnd satisfaction in any fatherlandishness, andknow how to love the south in the north and the north in the south, –the born Mediterraneans, the “good Europeans.” – It was for them that Bizet made music, this last genius to have seen a new beauty and seduction, – who discovered a piece of the southernness of music .  I recommend taking a number of precautions against German music. Suppose that someone loves the south like I do, as an immense schoolfor convalescence of both the most spiritual and the most sensual kind,as an unbridled, sun-drenched, sun-transﬁguration that spreads across ahigh-handed, self-assured existence: such a person will learn to be some-what careful with German music, because, along with ruining his taste,it will ruin his health again too. If someone like this (who is southernnot by descent but by belief ) dreams about the future of music, he will also have to dream about music being redeemed from the north, and havethe prelude to a more profound and powerful, perhaps more evil andmysterious music in his ears, a supra-German music that does not fade,yellow , or pale at the sight of the voluptuous blue sea or the luminousMediterranean sky , which is what happens with all German music; asupra-European music that still stands its ground before the brown sun-sets of the desert, whose soul is related to the palm tree, and that knows Bismarck’s famous phrase. In German: Mittell¨ andler (literally: people whose country is in the middle). ",598

Although, admittedly ,it is not so apparent given the rude clamor with which Wagner is resistedand opposed in France today , it nonetheless remains the case that late French romanticism of the ’ s and Richard Wagner belong most closely and intimately together.

They were all dominated by literature, up totheir eyes and ears – the ﬁrst artists with an education in world literature. For the most part, they were themselves writers, poets, go-betweens andmixers of the arts and the senses (as a musician, Wagner belongs amongpainters, as a poet, among musicians, as an artist in general, among actors);they were all fanatics of expression “at any cost” (I emphasize Delacroix, Wagner’s next of kin), all of them great discoverers in the realm of thesublime as well as the repugnant and repulsive, even greater discoverers ineffects, in showmanship, in the art of window displays; they were all talentsfar above their genius –, virtuosos through and through, with uncannyaccess to everything tempting, seductive, compelling, and subversive, bornenemies of logic and straight lines, longing for the foreign, the exotic, themonstrous, the crooked, the self-contradictory .

Page 187,"Part  What is noble?  Every enhancement so far in the type “man” has been the work of an aristocratic society – and that is how it will be, again and again, since thissort of society believes in a long ladder of rank order and value distinctionsbetween men, and in some sense needs slavery . Without the pathos of distance as it grows out of the ingrained differences between stations, out of the way the ruling caste maintains an overview and keeps looking downon subservient types and tools, and out of this caste’s equally continuousexercise in obeying and commanding, in keeping away and below – withoutthis pathos, that other , more mysterious pathos could not have grown at all, that demand for new expansions of distance within the soul itself,the development of states that are increasingly high, rare, distant, tautlydrawn and comprehensive, and in short, the enhancement of the type“man,” the constant “self-overcoming of man” (to use a moral formula ina supra-moral sense). Of course, you cannot entertain any humanitarianillusions about how an aristocratic society originates (and any elevationof the type “man” will presuppose an aristocratic society –): the truth isharsh. Let us not be deceived about how every higher culture on earthhasbegun ! Men whose nature was still natural, barbarians in every terrible sense of the word, predatory people who still possessed an unbrokenstrength of will and lust for power threw themselves on weaker, morecivilized, more peaceful races of tradesmen perhaps, or cattle breeders;or on old and mellow cultures in which the very last life-force was ﬂaringup in brilliant ﬁreworks of spirit and corruption. The noble caste alwaysstarted out as the barbarian caste. Their supremacy was in psychic, not ",412
Page 188,"Beyond Good and Evil physical strength, – they were more complete people (which at any level amounts to saying “more complete beasts” –).  Corruption, as an expression of the fact that anarchy threatens inside theinstincts and that the foundation of the affects, which we call “life,” hasbeen shaken: corruption means fundamentally different things, depend-ing on the life-form in which it manifests itself. When, for instance, anaristocracy like that in France at the beginning of the Revolution throws away its privileges with a sublime disgust and sacriﬁces itself to an excess of its moral feeling, then this is corruption. It was really just the ﬁnal act of that centuries-long corruption in which the aristocracy graduallyrelinquished its dominant authority and was reduced to a mere function of the kingdom (and, in the end, to its trinket and showpiece). But theessential feature of a good, healthy aristocracy is that it does not feel that it is a function (whether of the kingdom or of the community) but insteadfeels itself to be the meaning and highest justiﬁcation (of the kingdom or community), – and, consequently , that it accepts in good conscience the sacriﬁce of countless people who have to be pushed down and shrunk intoincomplete human beings, into slaves, into tools, all for the sake of the aris- tocracy . Its fundamental belief must always be that society cannot exist for the sake of society , but only as the substructure and framework for raisingan exceptional type of being up to its higher duty and to a higher stateofbeing . In the same way , the sun-seeking, Javanese climbing plant called thesipo matador will wrap its arms around an oak tree so often and for such a long time that ﬁnally , high above the oak, although still supportedby it, the plant will be able to unfold its highest crown of foliage and showits happiness in the full, clear light.  Mutually refraining from injury , violence, and exploitation, placing yourwill on par with the other’s: in a certain, crude sense, these practicescan become good manners between individuals when the right conditionsare present (namely , that the individuals have genuinely similar quanti-ties of force and measures of value, and belong together within a singlebody). But as soon as this principle is taken any further, and maybe even ",539
Page 189,"What is noble? held to be the fundamental principle of society, it immediately shows it- self for what it is: the will to negate life, the principle of disintegration and decay. Here we must think things through thoroughly , and ward offany sentimental weakness: life itself is essentially a process of appropriat- ing, injuring, overpowering the alien and the weaker, oppressing, beingharsh, imposing your own form, incorporating, and at least, the very least,exploiting, – but what is the point of always using words that have been stamped with slanderous intentions from time immemorial? Even a bodywithin which (as we presupposed earlier) particular individuals treat eachother as equal (which happens in every healthy aristocracy): if this bodyis living and not dying, it will have to treat other bodies in just thoseways that the individuals it contains refrain from treating each other. It will have to be the embodiment of will to power, it will want to grow ,spread, grab, win dominance, – not out of any morality or immorality , butbecause it is alive , and because life isprecisely will to power. But there is no issue on which the base European consciousness is less willing tobe instructed than this; these days, people everywhere are lost in raptur-ous enthusiasms, even in scientiﬁc disguise, about a future state of societywhere “the exploitative character” will fall away: – to my ears, that soundsas if someone is promising to invent a life that dispenses with all organicfunctions. “Exploitation” does not belong to a corrupted or imperfect, primitive society: it belongs to the essence of being alive as a fundamental organic function; it is a result of genuine will to power, which is just thewill of life. – Although this is an innovation at the level of theory , – at thelevel of reality , it is the primal fact of all history . Let us be honest with ourselves to this extent at least! –  As I was wandering through the many subtle and crude moralities thathave been dominant or that still dominate over the face of the earth, I foundcertain traits regularly recurring together and linked to each other. Inthe end, two basic types became apparent to me and a fundamental dis-tinction leapt out. There is a master morality and a slave morality ; – I will immediately add that in all higher and more mixed cultures, attempts tonegotiate between these moralities also appear, although more frequentlythe two are confused and there are mutual misunderstandings. In fact, yousometimes ﬁnd them sharply juxtaposed – inside the same person even, ",571
Page 190,"Beyond Good and Evil within a single soul. Moral value distinctions have arisen within either a dominating type that, with a feeling of well-being, was conscious of thedifference between itself and those who were dominated – or alterna-tively , these distinctions arose among the dominated people themselves,the slaves and dependants of every rank. In the ﬁrst case, when domi-nating people determine the concept of “good,” it is the elevated, proud states of soul that are perceived as distinctive and as determining rankorder. The noble person separates himself off from creatures in which theopposite of such elevated, proud states is expressed: he despises them. Itis immediately apparent that, in this ﬁrst type of morality , the contrastbetween “good” and “bad” amounts to one between “noble” and “despi- cable” (the contrast between “good” and “ evil ” has a different lineage). People who were cowardly , apprehensive, and petty , people who thoughtnarrowly in terms of utility – these were the ones despised. But the samecan be said about distrustful people with their uneasy glances, about grov-elers, about dog-like types of people who let themselves be mistreated,about begging ﬂatterers and, above all, about liars: – it is a basic belief ofaristocrats that base peoples are liars. “W e who are truthful” – that is whatthe nobility of ancient Greece called themselves. It is obvious that moralexpressions everywhere were ﬁrst applied to people and then, only later and derivatively , to actions (which is why it is a tremendous mistake when historians of morality take their point of departure from questions suchas “why do acts of pity get praised?”). The noble type of person feels that hedetermines value, he does not need anyone’s approval, he judges that “what is harmful to me is harmful in itself,” he knows that he is the onewho gives honor to things in the ﬁrst place, he creates values .H eh o n o r s everything he sees in himself: this sort of morality is self-glorifying. Inthe foreground, there is the feeling of fullness, of power that wants tooverﬂow , the happiness associated with a high state of tension, the con-sciousness of a wealth that wants to make gifts and give away . The nobleperson helps the unfortunate too, although not (or hardly ever) out ofpity , but rather more out of an impulse generated by the over-abundanceof power. In honoring himself, the noble man honors the powerful as wellas those who have power over themselves, who know how to speak andbe silent, who joyfully exercise severity and harshness over themselves,and have respect for all forms of severity and harshness. “W otan has put a hard heart in my breast,” reads a line from an old Scandinavian saga:this rightly comes from the soul of a proud Viking. This sort of a man ",676
Page 191,"What is noble? is even proud of not being made for pity: which is why the hero of the saga adds, by way of warning, “If your heart is not hard when you areyoung, it will never be hard.” The noble and brave types of people whothink this way are the furthest removed from a morality that sees preciselypity , actions for others, and d´esint´eressement as emblematic of morality . A faith in yourself, pride in yourself, and a fundamental hostility and ironywith respect to “selﬂessness” belong to a noble morality just as certainlyas does a slight disdain and caution towards sympathetic feelings and“warm hearts.” – The powerful are the ones who know how to honor; it is their art, their realm of invention. A profound reverence for age andorigins – the whole notion of justice is based on this doub le reverence –, a faith and a prejudice in favor of forefathers and against future generationsis typical of the morality of the powerful. And when, conversely , peoplewith “modern ideas” believe almost instinctively in “progress” and “thefuture,” and show a decreasing respect for age, this gives sufﬁcient evi- dence of the ignoble origin of these “ideas.” But, most of all, the moralityof dominating types is foreign and painful to contemporary taste due toits stern axiom that people have duties only towards their own kind; thatwhen it comes to creatures of a lower rank, to everything alien, people areallowed to act as they see ﬁt or “from the heart,” and in any event, “beyondgood and evil” –: things like pity might have a place here. The capacityand duty to experience extended gratitude and vengefulness – both onlyamong your own kind –, subtlety in retaliation, reﬁnement in concepts of friendship, a certain need to have enemies (as ﬂue holes, as it were,for the affects of jealousy , irascibility , arrogance, – basically , in order to be a good friend ): all these are characteristic features of noble morality which, as I have suggested, is not the morality of “modern ideas,” and this makes it difﬁcult for us to relate to, and also difﬁcult for us to digit up and lay it open. – It is different with the second type of morality ,slave morality . What if people who were violated, oppressed, suffering, unfree, exhausted, and unsure of themselves were to moralize: what typeof moral valuations would they have? A pessimistic suspicion of the wholecondition of humanity would probably ﬁnd expression, perhaps a con-demnation of humanity along with its condition. The slave’s gaze resentsthe virtues of the powerful. It is skeptical and distrustful, it has a subtle mistrust of all the “good” that is honored there –, it wants to convince Disinterestedness. ",666
Page 192,"Beyond Good and Evil itself that even happiness is not genuine there. Conversely , qualities that serve to alleviate existence for suffering people are pulled out and ﬂoodedwith light: pity , the obliging, helpful hand, the warm heart, patience, in-dustriousness, humility , and friendliness receive full honors here –, sincethese are the most useful qualities and practically the only way of holdingup under the pressure of existence. Slave morality is essentially a moral-ity of utility . Here we have the point of origin for that famous oppositionbetween “good” and “ evil.” Evil is perceived as something powerful and dangerous; it is felt to contain a certain awesome quality , a subtlety andstrength that block any incipient contempt. According to the slave moral-ity then, “evil” inspires fear; but according to the master morality ,i ti s “good ” that inspires and wants to inspire fear, while the “bad” man is seen as contemptible. The opposition comes to a head when, following the logicof slave morality , a hint of contempt (however slight and well disposed)ﬁnally comes to be associated with even its idea of “good,” because withinthe terms of slave morality , the good man must always be unthreatening :h e is good-natured, easy to deceive, maybe a bit stupid, un bonhomme . Wher- ever slave morality holds sway , language shows a tendency for the words“good” and “stupid” to come closer together. – A ﬁnal fundamental dis- tinction: the desire for freedom , the instinct for happiness, and subtleties in the feeling of freedom necessarily belong to slave morals and morality ,just as an artistry and enthusiasm in respect and devotion are invariantsymptoms of an aristocratic mode of thinking and valuing. – This clearlyshows why love as passion (our European specialty) must have had a purely noble descent: it is known to have been invented in the knightly poetry ofProvence, by those magniﬁcent, inventive men of the “ gai saber .” Europe is indebted to these men for so many things, almost for itself.  Vanity is perhaps one of the most difﬁcult things for a noble person tocomprehend: he will be tempted to keep denying it when a different typeof man will almost be able to feel it in his hands. He has difﬁculty imag-ining creatures who would try to inspire good opinions about themselvesthat they themselves do not hold – and consequently do not “deserve” A good simple fellow . Gay science. ",604
Page 193,"What is noble? either –, and who would then end up believing these good opinions. For one thing, this strikes the noble as being so tasteless and showing such a lack ofself-respect, and, for another thing, it seems so baroque and unreasonableto him, that he would gladly see vanity as an exception and stay skeptical inmost of the cases where it is brought up. For example, he will say: “I can bewrong about my own worth and still insist that other people acknowledgeit to be what I say it is, – but that is not vanity (instead, it is arrogance or, more frequently , it is what they call ‘humility’ or ‘modesty’).” Or alter- natively: “There are many reasons why I can enjoy other people’s goodopinions, perhaps because I love and honor them and rejoice in each oftheir joys, and perhaps also because their good opinions conﬁrm and re- inforce my faith in my own good opinion of myself, perhaps because otherpeople’s good opinions are useful or look as though they could be usefulto me, even when I don’t agree with them, – but none of that is vanity .” It is only when forced (namely with the help of history) that the nobleperson realizes that from time immemorial, in all strata of people who arein some way dependent, base people were only what they were considered to be : – not being at all accustomed to positing values, the only value the base person attributes to himself is the one his masters have attributed tohim (creating values is the true right of masters ). W e can see it as the result of a tremendous atavism that, to this day , ordinary people still wait for an opinion to be pronounced about themselves before instinctively deferringto it. And this is by no means only the case with “good” opinions – they defer to bad and unfair ones as well (for instance, just think about most ofthe self-estimations and self-underestimations that devout women acceptfrom their father confessors and, in general, that devout Christians acceptfrom their church). As a matter of fact, in keeping with the slow approachof a democratic order of things (and its cause, the mixing of blood be-tween masters and slaves), the originally rare and noble urge to ascribe toyourself a value that comes from yourself, and to “think well” of yourself is now increasingly widespread and encouraged. But in every age it isopposed by an older, broader, and more thoroughly ingrained tendency , –and in the phenomenon of “vanity ,” this older tendency gains mastery over the younger. The vain take pleasure in every good opinion they hear about themselves (abstracted entirely from the point of view of utility ,and just as much removed from truth or falsity), just as they suffer fromevery bad opinion.

Conversely , people know from the experience of breeders that species with overabundant diets and,in general, more than their share of protection and care, will immediatelyshow a striking tendency towards variations of the type, and will be rich inwonders and monstrosities (including monstrous vices). Y ou only need tosee an aristocratic community (such as V enice or an ancient Greek polis ) as an organization that has been established, whether voluntarily or in-voluntarily , for the sake of breeding : the people living there together are self-reliant and want to see their species succeed, mainly because if theydo not succeed they run a horrible risk of being eradicated. Here there are none of the advantages, excesses, and protections that are favorableto variation. The species needs itself to be a species, to be somethingthat, by virtue of its very hardness, uniformity , and simplicity of form,can succeed and make itself persevere in constant struggle with its neigh-bors or with the oppressed who are or threaten to become rebellious. Atremendous range of experiences teaches it which qualities are primarilyresponsible for the fact that, despite all gods and men, it still exists, itkeeps prevailing. It calls these qualities virtues, and these are the onlyvirtues it fosters. It does so with harshness; in fact, it desires harshness.Every aristocratic morality is intolerant about the education of the young,disposal over women, marriage customs, relations between old and youngand penal laws (which only concern deviants): – it considers intolerance itself to be a virtue, under the rubric of “justice.” A type whose traits are few in number but very strong, a species of people who are strict,warlike, clever, and silent, close to each other and closed up (which gives In German: Art.

Page 195,"What is noble? them the most subtle feeling for the charms and nuances of association) will, in this way , establish itself (as a species) over and above the changeof generations. The continuous struggle with constant unfavorable con- ditions is, as I have said, what causes a type to become sturdy and hard.But, eventually , a fortunate state will arise and the enormous tension willrelax; perhaps none of the neighbors are enemies anymore, and the meansof life, even of enjoying life, exist in abundance. With a single stroke,the bonds and constraints of the old discipline are torn: it does not seemto be necessary any more, to be a condition of existence, – if it wantedto continue, it could do so only as a form of luxury , as an archaic taste . Variation, whether as deviation (into something higher, ﬁner, rarer) or as degeneration and monstrosity , suddenly comes onto the scene in the greatest abundance and splendor; the individual dares to be individual and different. At these turning points of history , a magniﬁcent, diverse,jungle-like growth and upward striving, a kind of tropical tempo in the competition to grow will appear alongside (and often mixed up and tan-gled together with) an immense destruction and self-destruction. This isdue to the wild egoisms that are turned explosively against each other,that wrestle each other “for sun and light,” and can no longer derive any limitation, restraint, or refuge from morality as it has existed so far. Itwas this very morality that accumulated the tremendous amount of forceto put such a threatening tension into the bow: – and now it is, now itis being “outlived.” The dangerous and uncanny point has been reachedwhen the greatest, most diverse, most comprehensive life lives past the old morality . The “individual” is left standing there, forced to give him-self laws, forced to rely on his own arts and wiles of self-preservation,self-enhancement, self-redemption. There is nothing but new whys andhows; there are no longer any shared formulas; misunderstanding is al-lied with disregard; decay , ruin, and the highest desires are horribly en-twined; the genius of the race overﬂows from every cornucopia of goodand bad; there is a disastrous simultaneity of spring and autumn, ﬁlledwith new charms and veils that are well suited to the young, still unex-hausted, still indefatigable corruption. Danger has returned, the motherof morals, great danger, displaced onto the individual this time, ontothe neighbor or friend, onto the street, onto your own child, onto yourown heart, onto all of your own-most, secret-most wishes and wills: andthe moral philosophers emerging at this time – what will they have topreach? These sharp observers and layabouts discover that everything ",631

The subtlety , quality , and stature of a soul is putdangerously to the test when something of the ﬁrst rank passes by beforethe shudders of authority are there to protect it from intrusive clutchesand crudeness: something that goes on its way like a living touchstone,undiscovered, unmarked, and experimenting, perhaps voluntarily cov-ered and disguised.

On the other hand, there is an involuntary hush, a hesitationof the eye and a quieting of every gesture, all of which indicate that thesoul feels the presence of something deserving the highest honors. The way in which respect for the Bible has, on the whole, been maintained in Europe might be the best piece of discipline and reﬁnement in mannersthat Europe owes to Christianity . Books with this sort of profundity andultimate meaning need the protection of an externally imposed tyrannyof authority; this way , they can last through the millennia that are needed to use them up and ﬁgure them out.

Conversely , what is perhaps the mostdisgusting thing about so-called scholars, the devout believers in “mod-ern ideas,” is their lack of shame, the careless impudence of their eyes and hands that touch, taste, and feel everything.

It is utterly impossible that a personmight fail to have the qualities and propensities of his elders and ancestors in his body: however much appearances might speak against it. This isthe problem of race. If you know anything about the ancestors, you candraw conclusions about the child.

I mean that ﬁrm belief that other beingswill, by nature, have to be subordinate to a being “like us” and will have to sacriﬁce themselves. The noble soul accepts this fact of its egoism withoutany question-mark, and also without feeling any harshness, compulsion,or caprice in it, but rather as something that may well be grounded inthe primordial law of things. If the noble soul were to try to name thisphenomenon, it would call it “justice itself.” It admits to itself, under certain circumstances (that at ﬁrst give it pause), that there are otherswith rights equal to its own. As soon as it is clear about this questionof rank, it will move among these equals and “equally righted” with anassured modesty and a gentle reverence equal to how it treats itself, inaccordance with an inborn, celestial mechanics that all stars know so well.This is just another piece of its egoism, this ﬁnesse and self-limitation in dealing with equals – every star is an egoist of this sort. And the noble soul honors itself in them and in the rights that it gives them; it has no doubt that the exchange of rights and honors belongs to the natural stateof things too, as the essence of all interaction. The noble soul gives as it takes, out of the passionate and sensitive instinct of retribution that is sofundamental to it. The concept of “mercy” is senseless and noisome inter pares ; there might be a sublime way of letting gifts fall down on you from above, as it were, and lapping them up like raindrops; but the noble soulhas no talent for this art and conduct. Its egoism gets in the way: it doesnot generally like looking “upwards,” – but rather ahead , horizontally and slowly , or downwards: – it knows that it is high up .–  “One can only truly admire those who do not seek themselves.” – Goethe to Rat Schlosser. “Try expelling nature with a pitchfork and it keeps coming back,” from Horace’s Epistolae ,I ,, . Between equals. ",602

Usingthe same words is not enough to get people to understand each other: theyhave to use the same words for the same species of inner experiences too;ultimately , people have to have the same experience base . This is why a people in a community will understand each other better than they under-stand people belonging to other groups, even when they all use the samelanguage. Or rather, when individuals have lived together for a long timeunder similar conditions (of climate, soil, danger, necessities, work), therearises something that “understands itself ” – a people. In all souls, an equal number of frequently recurring experiences have gained an upper handover ones that occur less frequently: understanding takes place faster andfaster on this basis (the history of language is the history of a process ofabbreviation); and people join closer and closer together on the basis ofthis understanding. The greater the danger, the greater the need to agreequickly and easily about necessities. Not to misunderstand each other when there is danger: people require this in order to interact with eachother. In every friendship or relationship, people still put this principleto the test: nothing will last once the discovery is made that one of thetwo feels, means, senses, wishes, fears something different from the otherwhen using the same words. (Fear of the “eternal misunderstanding”: this is the benevolent genius that so often keeps people of the oppositesex from rushing into relationships at the insistence of their hearts andsenses – and not some Schopenhauerian “genius of the species” –!) What In German: Gemeinheit .

Now , assuming that needs have onlyever brought people together when they could somehow indicate similarrequirements and similar experiences with similar signs, then it follows,on the whole, that the easy communicability of needs (which ultimatelymeans having only average and base experiences) must have been the most forceful of the forces that have controlled people so far. People who aremore alike and ordinary have always been at an advantage; while peo-ple who are more exceptional, reﬁned, rare, and difﬁcult to understand will easily remain alone, prone to accidents in their isolation and rarely propagating.

In almost ev- ery psychologist, you ﬁnd a telling inclination and preference for dealingwith normal, well-ordered people.

What torture these great artists and higher people in general are for anyone who has ever guessed what they really are! It is easy to imaginethat these men will soon be subject to eruptions of boundless and most devoted pity from women in particular (who are clairvoyant in the world of suffering and whose desires to help and save far exceed their ability toactually do so).

The hermitdoes not believe that a philosopher – given that a philosopher was alwaysa hermit ﬁrst – has ever expressed his actual and ﬁnal opinions in books:don’t people write books precisely to keep what they hide to themselves?In fact, he will doubt whether a philosopher could even have “ﬁnal and actual” opinions, whether for a philosopher every cave does not have,must not have, an even deeper cave behind it – a more extensive, stranger, richer world above the surface, an abyss behind every ground, under every “groundwork.” Every philosophy is a foreground philosophy – that is a hermit’s judgment: “There is something arbitrary in hisstopping here, looking back, looking around, in his not digging any deeper here , and putting his spade away – there is also something suspicious about it.”Every philosophy conceals a philosophy too: every opinion is also a hiding place, every word is also a mask.  Every profound thinker is more afraid of being understood than of beingmisunderstood. The latter might hurt his vanity; but the former hurts hisheart and his sympathy which always says: “Oh, why do you want thingsto be as hard for you as they are for me?”  The human being is a diverse, hypocritical, artiﬁcial, and opaque animal, uncanny to other animals more because of his cunning and cleverness thanhis strength; the human being invented good conscience so that he couldenjoy his soul as something simple , for once; and the whole of morality is a brave and lengthy falsiﬁcation that makes it possible to look at the soulwith anything like pleasure. Perhaps this point of view involves a muchbroader conception of “art” than people are used to. In German: ein Abgrund hinter jedem Grunde, unter jeder “Begr¨ undung.” ",550
Page 210,"Beyond Good and Evil  A philosopher: this is a person who constantly experiences, sees, hears, suspects, hopes, and dreams extraordinary things; who is struck by hisown thoughts as if from outside, from above and below , as if by histype of events and lightning bolts; who is perhaps a storm himself, pregnantwith new lightning; a fatal person in whose vicinity things are always rumbling, growling, gaping, and acting in uncanny ways. A philosopher:oh, a being who is frequently running away from himself, frequently afraid of himself, – but too curious not to always come back to himself ...  A man who says: “I like that, I’ll take it for my own and protect it and defend it against everyone”; a man who can conduct business, carry outa resolution, be faithful to a thought, hold on to a woman, punish anddefeat someone for being insolent; a man who has his anger and his sword,and whom the weak, the suffering, the distressed, and even the animalslike to come to and, by nature, belong to; in short, a man who is naturallymaster , – if a man like this has pity , well then! this pity is worth something! But what good is the pity of the sufferer! Or particularly , the pity of those who preach it! Almost everywhere in Europe today , there is a morbidover-sensitivity and susceptibility to pain, as well as an excessive amountof complaining and an increased tenderness that wants to dress itself up assomething higher, using religion as well as bits and pieces of philosophy , –there is a real cult of suffering. The unmanliness of what is christened “pity” in the circles of these enthusiasts is always, I think, the ﬁrst thing thatstrikes your eye. – This latest type of bad taste needs to be forcefully andthoroughly exorcized; and ultimately , I would like people to put the goodamulet of “ gai saber ” around their hearts and necks to ﬁght it off, – “gay science,” to make it germane to Germans.   The Olympian vice. – In spite of that philosopher who, being a true Englishman, tried to give laughter a bad reputation among all thoughtful Nietzsche is again playing on the similarity between Mitleiden (pity) and leiden (to suffer). In German: um es den Deutschen zu verdeutlichen (literally: to clarify it to Germans). ",590

And given that even gods philosophize (a conclusion I have been drawnto many times –), I do not doubt that they know a new and super-humanway of laughing – at the expense of everything serious! Gods like to makefun of things: it seems as if they cannot stop laughing, even during holyrites.  The genius of the heart, as it is possessed by that great hidden one, thetempter god and born pied piper of consciences, whose voice knows how to descend into the underworld of every soul, whose every word and every glance conveys both consideration and a wrinkle of temptation, whose mastery includes an understanding of how to seem – not like whathe is but rather like one more compulsion for his followers to keep pressing closer to him, to keep following him more inwardly and thoroughly: – thegenius of the heart, that makes everything loud and complacent fall silentand learn to listen, that smoothes out rough souls and gives them thetaste of a new desire, – to lie still, like a mirror that the deep sky canmirror itself upon –; the genius of the heart, that teaches the foolish andover-hasty hand to hesitate and reach out more delicately; that guesses thehidden and forgotten treasure, the drop of goodness and sweet spiritualityunder thick, dull ice, and is a divining rod for every speck of gold that haslong been buried in a prison of mud and sand; the genius of the heart,that enriches everyone who has come into contact with it, not makingthem blessed or surprised, or leaving them feeling as if they have beengladdened or saddened by external goods; rather, they are made richer inthemselves, newer than before, broken open, blown on, and sounded outby a thawing wind, perhaps less certain, more gentle, fragile, and broken,but full of hopes that do not have names yet, full of new wills and currents,full of new indignations and countercurrents ...but what am I doing, my friends?

Like everyone who, from childhood, has constantly been underway and abroad, I have had many strange and not unthreatening spirits runacross my path, but especially the one I have just been talking about, whohas crossed my path again and again – in other words, nobody less than the god Dionysus , that great ambiguity and tempter god, to whom, as you know , I once offered my ﬁrstborn in all secrecy and reverence. I seem to be the last one to have offered him a sacriﬁce : because I have not found anyone who understood what I was doing then. In the meantime,I have learned much, all too much more about the philosophy of thisgod, passed on, as I said, from mouth to mouth – I, the last discipleand initiate of the god Dionysus: and can I, at last, start to give you,my friends, a small taste of this philosophy , as far as I am permitted? Inundertones, which would be best, since it concerns many things that aresecret, new , foreign, strange, uncanny . Even the fact that Dionysus is a philosopher and that, consequently , even gods philosophize, seems to me like something new and not without its dangers, something that might arouse mistrust precisely among philosophers, – among you, my friends,it has less opposition, unless it comes too late and at the wrong time: I havebeen told that you do not like believing in God and gods these days. Andperhaps in recounting my story , I will have to take frankness further thanwill always be agreeable to the strict habits of your ears? Certainly , thegod in question went further in dialogues like this, much, much further,and was always many steps ahead of me ...In fact, if it were permissible to follow human custom in ascribing beautiful, solemn names of splendorand virtue to him, I would have to offer many praises for his explorer’s,discoverer’s heart, for his daring and genuine honesty , his truthfulnessand his love of wisdom. But a god like this will have no use at all for thishonorable rubbish and splendor. “Keep this for yourself,” he would say ,“and for those like you and anyone else who needs it! I – have no reasonfor covering my nakedness!” – Y ou can guess: this type of divinity andphilosopher is, perhaps, lacking in shame? – He once said: “I love humans under certain circumstances” – meaning Ariadne, who was present –:“I think humans are pleasant, brave, inventive animals that have no equalon earth, they ﬁnd their way around any labyrinth.
